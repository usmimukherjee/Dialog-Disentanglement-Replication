mediawiki 2019-02-18 [04:19:44] * bd808 offers Azxiana a soothing beverage  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [04:20:17] <Azxiana>	 bd808: If you desire a case study on moving to Gitlab I am about to finish pushing all of the Hydra Wiki Platform/Gamepedia code up to our Gitlab account this coming week.  Doing some final "make sure we don't commit secrets" clean up before I make the final push.  https://gitlab.com/hydrawiki  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [04:20:28] <Azxiana>	 All of our Jira tickets are imported as well.  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [04:21:48] <bd808>	 neat. Debian has been moving into a local GitLab too which could provide us with some info  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [04:23:22] <ofbeaton>	 I've been trying to decide what to present to my collegues for code review so I've been reading a lot of discussions. Seems like more people like the code review process in phab/gerrit better than github/gitlab. But everyone seems to agree the later is more well known in the wider community.  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [04:24:22] <ofbeaton>	 we already use phab for ticketing so I was intreagued by phab differential and hoped wikimedia was using it  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [04:24:46] <Azxiana>	 Gerrit requires additional git extensions to make work and has a lot of archaic conventions for submitting code that make it easy to clobber the code review/your local branch.(Making it a giant pain in the ass to recover from.)  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [04:26:38] <ofbeaton>	 anyways, not looking to start a debate, was just hoping to find the logs of an existing one that wikimedia already likely had :) so thanks  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [04:27:48] <bd808>	 ofbeaton: Differential is interesting in that it is completely agnostic of the backing VCS system. Its really 2 parts: a patch based code review system, and a php library/script that know how to submit patches from a VCS working copy  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [04:28:14] <ofbeaton>	 bd808: so differential can work well on SVN?  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [04:28:46] <ofbeaton>	 because that is super interesting to me  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [04:29:20] <bd808>	 I'm pretty sure it can, yes.  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [04:29:54] <bd808>	 assuming arc knows how to extract/apply patches to svn  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [04:31:22] <bd808>	 seems like it does -- https://secure.phabricator.com/T5029  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [04:32:22] <bd808>	 hmmm... actually that doesn't say that arc know how to do this  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [04:33:32] <bd808>	 Yes, it does "If you use arc, we'll also automatically generate full-context diffs for you."  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [04:33:51] <bd808>	 I got confused by https://secure.phabricator.com/T4678  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [04:34:09] <bd808>	 which is about a specific snv workflow not being supported  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [04:34:36] * bd808 is glad to have escaped from svn many years ago  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [04:41:33] <ofbeaton>	 I'm just glad to have phased out my 20 year old maintenance mode software... and working on the 15 year now. Likely won't get lower than 10 tho  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [06:37:07] <N3X15>	 I will never understand how the devops at mediawiki stay sane keeping phabricator running  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [06:37:38] <N3X15>	 I've had to implement so many kludges  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [07:36:08] <Guest40756>	 Which version of parsoid is used in the offical website?  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [10:18:55] <Sveta>	 Is it possible to view the log of emails that I sent via EmailUser special page? If so, where can I view this?  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [10:19:38] <Reedy>	 Nope  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [10:20:14] <Sveta>	 Ok, I'll just use the ccme parameter to keep a log in my inbox I guess. Thanks in any case

mediawiki 2019-02-18 [11:13:54] <bawolff>	 atinaygan: There are some devs that speak hungarian, but probably not too many  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [11:14:21] <bawolff>	 This is also a slow time of day (a big portion of mw devs are based in US, where its 4 am right now, and also a holiday  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [11:14:27] <atinaygan>	 OK, I see, no problem! :)  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [11:15:19] <atinaygan>	 I hope, somebody will answer my question from MediaWiki soon. :)  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [11:15:24] <bawolff>	 atinaygan: putting your question through google translate, I think this is the wrong place to ask. Try asking at the #wikipedia-en-help irc channel  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [11:16:18] <bawolff>	  #mediawiki is supposed to be for help with the technical aspects of the software. Content stuff is handled by different people  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [11:21:32] <atinaygan>	 Not all the same that a country or a administrative unit is the 6th or 12th utmost (by area) in the world!  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [11:22:47] <atinaygan>	 I wrote that I have alredy wrote a message to the MediaWiki.  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [11:25:34] <bawolff>	 err, i guess i gave the wrong channel #wikipedia-en-help is gor english. Presumably #wikipedia-hu would be a better place  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [11:27:44] <bawolff>	 Sveta: If you were  a checkuser, there's a list kept for 90 days, but that really only includes that an email was sent, it doesn't say to who or what the subject was  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [13:38:31] <fcser_>	 Does any sort of aMediaWiki System Checka exist to show the ahealtha of the site? To check the site after doing a bunch of spam cleanup and core / extension upgrades / changes? Just wanting to make sure Iam not overlooking any issues after a bunch of changes.   
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [13:46:25] <Reedy>	 Not really, no  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [14:11:23] <fcser_>	 ok thanks Reedy   
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [14:16:06] <Finlay>	 is there a way to specify a wiki-relative path in a css file added by an extension?  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [14:16:30] <Finlay>	 I'm asking about a .css file, not some big .less compilation step  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [14:22:43] <Finlay>	 eh I guess I could just data embed all my images straight into the css and avoid the urls completely. especially given resource loader will do that anyways eventually  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [18:32:26] <IDrinkMi1>	 hi, was wondering if anyone has a guide for setting up visualeditor on a private wiki? when i try to load the visualeditor extension it breaks mediawiki -- nothing else seems to load on the homepage  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [18:50:53] <Skizzerz>	 IDrinkMi1: VE requires parsoid. Did you set that up as well?  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [18:51:04] <Skizzerz>	 also, you need to grab the right version of VE for your mediawiki version  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [18:58:04] <IDrinkMi1>	 i do have parsoid running, and it seems to be running in htop  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [20:31:37] <tgr>	 IDrinkMi1: check the parsoid logs, see if the mediawiki requests go there at all  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [20:31:53] <tgr>	 check the mediawiki logs, see what the error is  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [20:32:19] <tgr>	 make sure you are forwarding cookies, in theory that's the only difference for a private wiki  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [20:52:19] <IDrinkMi1>	 just checked the logs, here's what i got: https://paste.debian.net/1068803/  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [20:52:34] <IDrinkMi1>	 seems like it's dying after startup? this was after reloading the service  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [23:43:03] <jamespharvey20>	 /quit  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [23:56:35] <hutber>	 Ye its likely tha tyou've not set the right paths in your config IdrinkMil  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [23:56:46] <hutber>	 Anybody have any idea about this question I've had for some time now  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [23:56:46] <hutber>	 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54655194/resize-images-upon-upload-in-mediawiki  
mediawiki 2019-02-18 [23:58:50] <Sveta>	 With mediawiki, how do I receive email notifications of each change to a page which is on my watch list?  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [00:22:51] <Skizzerz>	 Sveta: you could hook your email client up to the RSS/Atom feed of your watchlist  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [00:23:33] <Skizzerz>	 beyond that, I think you'd need some sort of extension so that it doesn't check whether or not you've visited the page before sending you another notification  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [02:29:56] <red__>	 Having some trouble updating the the latest version 1.32.  when i run update.php from shell i get the error "PHP Fatal error:  Interface 'MediaWiki\User\UserIdentity' not found in '***/w/includes/user/User.php on line 47"  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [02:30:20] <red__>	 I've checked and UserIdentity.php exists and doesn't appear to have any errors in the file, trying to update from 1.30  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [02:59:56] <gry>	 Skizzerz, ok  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [03:13:46] <bd808>	 red__: hmm.. that sounds like an autoloader problem. My brain is too tired to think of how to start debugging though. :/  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [04:49:05] <N3X15>	 __red make sure you've run composer if you cloned from git  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [04:49:35] <N3X15>	 also, make sure you're on the REL1_32 branch rather than master  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [12:40:34] <rfme>	 greetings, is it possible to create some kind of template for a certain namespace? (so when a page inside a namespace is created a certain default text given for further edit?)  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [12:42:33] <Reedy>	 https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Creating_pages_with_preloaded_text  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [12:45:47] <rfme>	 thank you.   
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:22:02] <red__>	 mobrovac I downloaded the tarball from the official site, does that make a difference with composer?  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:22:11] <vlt_>	 Hi. I have one strange problem with my mediawiki  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:22:30] <vlt_>	 I have installed newest version 1.32 on my Centos 7  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:22:51] <vlt_>	 and everything works fine if I have original.domain.com/mediawiki  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:22:55] <red__>	 sorry n3x15  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:23:48] <vlt_>	 but when I create subdomain for example newsub.domain.com and Document Root points to /var/www/html/mediawiki I get some weird error: Not Found The requested URL /imediawiki/index.php/Main_Page was not found on this server.   
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:24:27] <vlt_>	 I have created one small html file to check if apache is doing some weird stuff  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:24:39] <vlt_>	 but it looks like it servers everything correctly  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:25:04] <vlt_>	 how come that mediawiki stop serving site when you create vhost?!?  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:26:47] <Reedy>	 That sounds like bad rewrites or not updated MW config  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:27:01] <vlt_>	 no .htaccess were set  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:27:18] <vlt_>	 I have set under LocalSettings.php new server info  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:28:09] <vlt_>	 script path is set to: $wgScriptPath = "/intranet"; this is the parent folder or should I say mediawiki installation folder  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:28:35] <vlt_>	 $wgServer = is also set to http://subdomain.domain.com  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:28:51] <vlt_>	 I have no clue what else is missing  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:28:57] <Reedy>	 "/imediawiki/index.php/Main_Page was not found on this server. "  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:29:00] <Reedy>	 What is imediawiki?  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:29:14] <vlt_>	 sorry for typo  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:29:31] <vlt_>	 it is basically /intranet/index.php/Main_Page  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:29:41] <vlt_>	 intranet is DocumentRoot  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:29:49] <vlt_>	 parent folder of whole mediawiki  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:30:21] <vlt_>	 but what is quite strange, why is index.php presented as some path?!?  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:30:30] <vlt_>	 index.php/Main_page  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:30:45] <Reedy>	 Because that's what MW uses to serve pages  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:30:51] <vlt_>	 ah, ok  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:30:51] <Reedy>	 Usually it's just rewritten to be pretty  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:31:00] <vlt_>	 ok  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:31:12] <vlt_>	 I am stuck and have no clue why is not serving page  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:31:20] <Reedy>	 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris and https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paris are the same etc  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:32:06] <vlt_>	 yes index.php?title... because ? is basically a query to db. I understand that, but there is / which confused me  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:32:18] <vlt_>	 again I am not programmer, so please bear with me :)  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:32:59] <Reedy>	 https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php/Paris works too ;P  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:33:34] <vlt_>	 so what can be the problem with mediawiki that is not recognizing new subdomain?  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:33:52] <vlt_>	 when vhost is created, webpage is not presented anymore  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:34:08] <vlt_>	 is there any part of data written in the database perhaps?  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:34:21] <Reedy>	 No  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:34:24] <Reedy>	 The error looks to be from your webserver, not from MW  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:34:48] <vlt_>	 if so, how is serving plain html file just fine?  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:34:55] <Reedy>	 rewrites failing?  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:35:24] <Reedy>	 /being incorrect  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:35:40] <vlt_>	 how to troubleshot that? as in DocumentRoot there is no .htaccess  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:36:06] <Reedy>	 Look at your webserver config files?  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:36:22] <vlt_>	 conf.d or conf?  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:36:32] <vlt_>	 as in conf.d there is no rewrite rules  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:36:36] <Reedy>	 Don't know, it depends on your setup  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:36:37] <vlt_>	 *are

mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:41:27] <red__>	 do I need to have composer installed when upgrading from 1.30 -> 1.32 using the tarball download?  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:43:11] <Reedy>	 For a stock install no  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:43:16] <Reedy>	 with other extensions, maybe  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:45:52] <red__>	 i have all extensions disabled, i tried it last night at I was getting an error that the UserIdentity interface wasn't found  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:46:31] <red__>	 but it's there in the same directory as user.php  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:46:40] <Reedy>	 That's not loaded with composer  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:47:13] <Reedy>	 And it's in the autoloader https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki/blob/REL1_32/autoload.php#L918  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:48:33] <Reedy>	 Unless your opcode cache is doing something odd  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:51:25] <red__>	 I disabled opcache thinking that would be the reason  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:51:49] <red__>	 but it seems that version of the autoloader does not match my version  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:52:12] <Reedy>	 Did it not get overwritten when you upgraded?  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:52:37] <Reedy>	 I don't think that class existed in 1.30  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:54:33] <red__>	 I'm not sure how it would have failed to get overwritten but it did exist in 1.30  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:54:48] <red__>	 thanks for the help, I'll try that after work tonight and see how it goes  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:55:24] <Reedy>	 heh  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:55:35] <Reedy>	 Yeah, autoload.php has been around for a while in various forms  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:55:44] <Reedy>	 It seems a reasonable candidate for starters  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:57:25] <red__>	 yeah I didn't know about that file, I used to do some extension development but that was back in like 1.15 so it's been a while since I've been familiar with the code and a lot has changed  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:58:13] <Reedy>	 would've been includes/Autoloader.php back then IIRC  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [13:58:55] <Reedy>	 Worth checking the other .php files in the root are up to date too.. They don't generally change much, but they do get random fixes now and again  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [14:05:44] <vlt_>	 have no clue... I cannot see any rewrite rule that is doing some crazy stuff  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [14:05:54] <vlt_>	 this is my vhost

mediawiki 2019-02-19 [14:10:21] <Reedy>	 This can't be right  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [14:10:32] <Reedy>	 unless you have a folder called /var/www/html/intranet/intranet  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [14:11:03] <vlt_>	 so how is this working without virtual host?  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [14:11:13] <vlt_>	 it should not work correct?  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [14:12:01] <Reedy>	 Well, you always had a virtual host  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [14:12:07] <Reedy>	 because apache won't serve anything either  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [14:12:16] <Reedy>	 But presumably the docroot was /var/www/html or something  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [14:12:19] <vlt_>	 let me change that to ""  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [14:12:27] <vlt_>	 and see how it behaves  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [14:14:43] <vlt_>	 goddamn, it is that  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [14:14:46] <vlt_>	 thnx mate  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [14:15:15] <vlt_>	 it appears when I did installation it wrote intranet under scripts even though I do not recall I place that path  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [14:15:26] <vlt_>	 but removing this and setting it to "" it works  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [14:15:41] <vlt_>	 sh*** how much time I wasted to this small thing :D  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [14:15:52] <vlt_>	 massive thanks!!!!  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [14:19:57] <Reedy>	 I'm guessing your original setup just used /var/www/html  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [14:20:07] <Reedy>	 You browsed to MW in intranet  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [14:20:14] <Reedy>	 So it used that as the addition from docroot  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [14:20:35] <Reedy>	 Then you used a new docroot which was deeper, and things are just like wtf  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [14:21:18] <vlt_>	 :D  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [19:22:32] <jubo2>	 Yo. Got a weird situation that worries me  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [19:23:23] <jubo2>	 The last edit here https://develop.consumerium.org/wiki/Special:RecentChanges?hidebots=1&limit=50&days=7&urlversion=2 says -6 bytes, but when I click on the diff https://develop.consumerium.org/w/index.php?title=Political_choice&curid=693&diff=49071&oldid=14141 it says "No changes"  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [19:24:12] <jubo2>	 What's going on here? The inconsistency brings worry to my mind.  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [19:24:49] <jubo2>	 "No difference" is the text being displayed on the diff page  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [19:25:47] <Skizzerz>	 excellent question  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [19:26:01] <Skizzerz>	 have you run any maintenance scripts since that edit?  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [19:27:03] <jubo2>	 Skizzerz: No. I did upgrade it to 1.32.0 a few days ago if that matters  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [19:29:19] <Skizzerz>	 I don't see any extensions offhand that would cause such an issue. I legitimately have no idea what's going on either  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [19:50:50] <MatmaRex>	 jubo2: Skizzerz: i've seen that happen when the old version had a bunch of newlines at the end. apparently at some point far in the past MediaWiki did not remove them, but now it does  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [19:52:00] <MatmaRex>	 https://develop.consumerium.org/wiki/Special:ApiSandbox#action=query&format=json&prop=revisions&titles=Political_choice&rvprop=ids%7Ctimestamp%7Cflags%7Ccomment%7Cuser%7Ccontent&rvlimit=max  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [19:52:16] <MatmaRex>	 looks like i was wrong, but had the right idea. the old version has \r\n newlines, new one has \n.  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [19:53:27] <jubo2>	 MatmaRex: Ok. Thanks for info. So I can assume this is exhibiting due to the upgrade to 1.32.0?  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [19:54:00] <jubo2>	 I can log in to the server and check from my changes.txt what was the old version, if that matters  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [19:54:09] <MatmaRex>	 the old revision is from 2003a probably more like the upgrade to MW 1.10 or something ;)  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [19:54:21] <jubo2>	 MatmaRex: oh, ok, thanks  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [19:54:35] <MatmaRex>	 i have no idea when this normalization was introduced, but it has been ages ago  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [20:09:31] <jorm>	 is there a channel or a person I can talk to about jquery.i18n?  siebrand?  santhosh?  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [20:16:33] <MatmaRex>	 there is a #mediawiki-i18n  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [20:16:37] <MatmaRex>	 not sure how active  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [20:27:26] <jorm>	 it is not very, looks like.  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [20:27:44] <jorm>	 i figured out my problem, though.  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [20:35:36] <extarys_>	 Huh, does nyone knows about this kind of errors? Fatal error: Uncaught TypeError: Argument 2 passed to MessageCache::isMainCacheable() must be of the type array, null given, called in /usr/share/nginx/gamewiki/includes/cache/MessageCache.php on line 1054 and defined in /usr/share/nginx/gamewiki/includes/cache/MessageCache.php:579  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [21:35:56] <FoxT>	 extarys_: Enable debugging and have a look at the stack trace to see what's causing it.  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [21:51:34] <extarys_>	 FoxT: It didn't told me much but then again I'm not quite used to MediaWiki, I'll do a pastebin  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [21:52:10] <extarys_>	 https://pastebin.com/U0tfbJaK  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [21:52:43] <extarys_>	 Maybe it has something to do with some language setting of some sort  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [21:54:05] <FoxT>	 extarys_: Odd that it ends at #5. Usually it should go up all the way to index.php.  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [22:16:35] <extarys_>	 I know. It usually happen once I submit a page I was editing  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [22:16:51] <extarys_>	 Mostly in MediaWiki but that doesn't prove anything  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [22:17:02] <extarys_>	 MediaWiki Namespace I meant  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [22:17:40] <extarys_>	 Current LocalSettings are $wgShowExceptionDetails = true;$wgDebugToolbar = true;$wgDebugLogFile = "/var/log/mediawiki/debug-{$wgDBname}.log";  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [22:18:54] <Platonides>	 extarys_: you would need a backtrace  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [22:19:01] <Platonides>	 I suspect a problem in some extension...  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [22:21:00] <extarys_>	 Is it possible to make mediawiki output more informations Platonides ?  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [22:21:53] <Platonides>	 isn't there more information on the debug log?  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [22:23:30] <extarys_>	 Nope  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [22:24:00] <Platonides>	 what do you have on line 1054?  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [22:24:27] <extarys_>	 I've open an article to edit, I usually get the error when I'm editing and previewing a lot without submiting. I'll wait 10 minutes and send a screenshot  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [22:24:35] <Platonides>	 no  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [22:24:36] <extarys_>	 Wait I'll go look  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [22:24:45] <Platonides>	 I mean line 1054 of MessageCache.php  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [22:25:08] <Platonides>	 if it doesn't give you a backtrace, we could force one :P  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [22:26:19] <extarys_>	 The line is: if ( !$this->isMainCacheable( $name, $this->overridable ) ) {  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [22:26:45] <Platonides>	 hmm, so $this->overridable is null there  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [22:26:46] <extarys_>	 The item is still saved in db, I usually go back and refresh and the changes are applied  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [22:27:32] <Platonides>	 you could add a line above that with if (!$this->overridable) throw new Exception("We reached line 1050 with a bad overridable");  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [22:28:40] <extarys_>	 Applied the change, I'll keep you posted  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [22:29:15] <Platonides>	 that will make it fail more noisely  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [22:29:22] <Platonides>	 but should give some more info  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [22:30:50] <extarys_>	 Indeed more 'noisely' XD  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [22:32:58] <extarys_>	 I could send a copy of my LocalSettings if it can help. I didn't change much stuff in it  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [22:35:12] <extarys_>	 Does the configuration: $wgShellLocale = "en_US.utf8";   is accurate? It came default to that but I've read that it changed, I'm not sure  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [22:45:49] <Platonides>	 that should be ok  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [22:45:56] <Platonides>	 as far as you have that locale generated  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [22:49:04] <extarys_>	 I confirmed that a moment ago - to make sure  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [22:51:40] <Platonides>	 anyway, an error on $wgShellLocale would only affect things executed on a different process  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [22:51:54] <Platonides>	 like thumbnail generation where there are special chars on the filename  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [22:52:01] <extarys_>	 I'm not sure if I'll be able to reproduce tonight but as soon as it does I'll tell ya :D  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [22:52:13] <extarys_>	 Yes I thought so but whil eI'm at it you know  
mediawiki 2019-02-19 [22:53:52] <Platonides>	 yeah, no problem  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [00:21:35] <Examknow>	 Hello all  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [01:29:03] <red__>	 I'm back with another error upgrading to 1.32 line 961 of loadbalencer got connection to aiowiki but expected local domain aiowiki-mediawiki  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [03:28:01] <Operator873>	 is anyone around that could explain what the Mediawiki API is looking for as far as the cookies being returned?  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [03:38:26] <rjhatl>	 I'm doing an upgrade from 1.16.0 to 1.32 (hopefully this isn't a Bad Idea) and getting stuck on the DB upgrade script. I've looked around online a bit but can't find what might be wrong here. Error and config details here: https://dpaste.de/Kg3z  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [03:38:37] <rjhatl>	 Thanks for any assistance!  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [03:44:37] <happyhappy22>	 hello, whenever I dont use ugly URLs, I get an infinite redirect loop  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [03:44:45] <happyhappy22>	 been a problem for months  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [03:46:47] <happyhappy22>	 nginx/1.14.2 --> Apache/2.4.6 --> mediawiki 3.1 (PHP version doesnt seem to matter)  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [03:47:07] <happyhappy22>	 I mean 1.31  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:05:46] <red__>	 rjhatl are you still there? I have the same problem I think I almost have it though  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:06:51] <extarys_>	 happyhappy22: could you send your nginx vhost configuration on a pastebin?  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:07:00] <tgr>	 Operator873: can you clarify the question?  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:07:14] <extarys_>	 happyhappy22: I had a lot of trouble myself setting nginx properly for short urls  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:07:31] <rjhatl>	 red__: Yup, still here  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:08:05] <red__>	 do you have a $wgDBmwschema specified in localsettings?  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:08:08] <Operator873>	 I'm attempting to have a bot log in via API. I can obtain login in token, but I'm failing when attempting to do the actual login. I am suspicious it is being caused by cookies  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:09:06] <rjhatl>	 Yep. Let me try commenting thatout.  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:09:10] <Sveta>	 Operator873, can i see your code example? i'll try to use it to log in to my wiki  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:10:45] <Operator873>	 I've picked up "wikidb_session <ccokie value>" and included it in the header during the attempted login  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:11:14] <rjhatl>	 red__, that worked - thanks! Now I'm on to db conversion errors :P  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:11:24] <rjhatl>	 err, update not conversion errors  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:11:39] <Operator873>	 I'm most curious about whether or not "UseDC master" should be returned as well  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:12:10] <Operator873>	 Sveta: I'm using a tcl script... It's a very rare language... can you support?  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:12:58] <Sveta>	 Operator873, i can install tcl on my computer, i reckon i can't help you without seeing the codes  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:13:02] <red__>	 glad I could help. I had to add the drop mysql permission so that update.php could do its thing then I removed it  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:13:09] <tgr>	 Operator873: using a library that manages HTTP cookies will probably make your life easier  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:13:34] <Operator873>	 tgr I've been using http package  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:13:38] <Operator873>	 would you suggest curl?  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:13:50] <tgr>	 if it's a standard installation you'll name <wiki>ID and <wiki>Session, IIRC  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:14:22] <tgr>	 (if you use bot passwords the names will be different)  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:15:11] <tgr>	 Operator873: curl can be used with the cookie jar + cookie file options should work  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:15:25] <tgr>	 I don't know much about tcl libraries  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:15:52] <tgr>	 but in general any library that has a cookie jar would probably do  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:15:53] <Operator873>	 It's mainly my fault. I keep procrastinating re-writing my bot in python  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:16:17] <Operator873>	 I'll rewrite for curl and see what happens  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:16:19] <tgr>	 you might need to enable it, or use a session instead of a connection, or some such  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:16:32] <tgr>	 in python it would be requests.Session for example  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:16:33] <happyhappy22>	 extarys_: here are the relevant configs https://pastebin.com/4EaNr1bT  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:17:06] <Operator873>	 thnks tgr   
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:19:00] <happyhappy22>	 my wiki works fine with ugly URLs, its just it does an infinite redirect no matter how I try to shorten the URL  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:22:10] <Sveta>	 Operator873, there is pywikibot if it is useful?  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:22:45] <Operator873>	 lol I've looked and considered many times.  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:23:09] <extarys_>	 happyhappy22: Did you put ton proper config in your LocalSettings file?  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:23:35] <extarys_>	 happyhappy22: Oh sorry just saw it at the end of the file you sent  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:25:50] <extarys_>	 happyhappy22: Add $wgUsePathInfo = true; in your LocalSettings too: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:$wgUsePathInfo  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:26:00] <rjhatl>	 OK, on my 1.16 --> 1.32 db upgrade, I'm now hitting an error during the batch conversion of user_options. The error says the Content model must be in the DB, not sure if this has anything to do with the "Turning off Content Handler DB fields" message at the start of the update.php script.  I clearly need to learn PHP.. Errors are here:  https://dpaste.de/opqQ. Thanks in advance for any pointers.  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:27:01] <happyhappy22>	 extarys_:just tried it, didnt fix it  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:27:31] <extarys_>	 :/ I'm not a pro at url rewrite but I couldn't find what cause it  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:27:57] <happyhappy22>	 I put in a support topic here https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Project:Support_desk  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:28:04] <happyhappy22>	 guess thats the proper place  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:28:05] <happyhappy22>	 ?  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:28:38] <happyhappy22>	 thought maybe it had to do with http and https ping-ponging between apache and nginx, but I have no idea  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:29:11] <extarys_>	 This is my old .htaccess: https://pastebin.com/brTNEgbf  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:29:39] <extarys_>	 Are you using apache only for mediawiki? If so you could use only nginxc  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:29:58] <extarys_>	 Yes I suppose this is the right place  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:30:12] <happyhappy22>	 well eventually apache is going to cover multiple sites  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:30:33] <happyhappy22>	 and will make a separate apache vhost etc etc  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:31:37] <extarys_>	 okok  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:32:24] <extarys_>	 I used to have a test mediawiki on a synology nas, the config above is from the default installation and it was working great (but not secure, you need to disallow access to /maintenance and /mw-config too, this was a local installation  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:37:40] <extarys_>	 I'm displaying a table with floats in it, I'm wraping the values in a template to try and change the background color depending on the value. How would I do this without having a tons of {{#expr}} ?  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [04:45:21] <rjhatl>	 OK, I resolved the DB update problem - I commented out all of the extensions in the local config and it works fine.  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [09:14:33] <santi_>	 DELETE: http://www.x2145-productions.technology/index.php?title=Cita_A_Ciegas

mediawiki 2019-02-20 [09:16:26] <santi_>	  because he lies on the page  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [09:30:32] <idlus>	 hi, is there a way to get the total number of results of an api.php query, short of browsing all pages?  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [09:30:52] <Sveta>	 santi_: speak with one of the administrators at the wiki  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [09:31:34] <Sveta>	 santi_: open the page titled "Special:ListUsers/sysop"  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [09:41:22] <santi_>	 thank you  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [14:30:59] <Mandevil>	 Hello folks. I am unable to get LDAP debug output. I have $wgDebugLogGroups['ldap'] = '/var/log/mediawiki/mw-ldap.log'; in my config, the directory is writable, but no logfile ever appears there.  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [14:31:07] <Mandevil>	 I tried /tmp etc. and it just doesn't log anything.  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [14:31:43] <bawolff>	 Mandevil: which ldap extension are you using?  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [14:32:06] <Mandevil>	 This one: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:LDAP_Authentication/Examples  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [14:32:10] <Malo778>	 Helloo  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [14:33:33] <Mandevil>	 I suspect that the expect that the extension is not used at all.  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [14:33:52] <Mandevil>	 But the config is there and seems OK. And the whole thing _used_to_work_.  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [14:36:38] <bawolff>	 Mandevil: did you also set $wgLDAPDebug = 3;  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [14:36:45] <Mandevil>	 Yes!  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [14:37:12] <bawolff>	 ok, in that case, i think you're right, it probably means the extension is not getting triggered  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [14:37:40] <Mandevil>	 How can I troubleshoot that?  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [14:37:51] <Mandevil>	 I am pretty certain it is correctly configured.  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [14:38:01] <bawolff>	 I think that extension had issues with MW 1.27 and greater, or is bugy on newer versions maybe  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [14:38:29] <Mandevil>	 Any other extension to use to authenticate against AD?  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [14:38:53] <idlus_>	 hi, is there a way to get the total number of results of an api.php query, short of browsing all the result pages?  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [14:40:27] <bawolff>	 idlus_: Generally no, particularly with queries that "continue" to another page, since MW does not do the whole query to save time, but only the part that is needed to show the current page  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [14:41:17] <idlus_>	 bawolff: understood, thanks  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [15:01:40] <wm-bot>	 Technical Advice IRC meeting starting in 60 minutes in channel #wikimedia-tech, hosts: @Tonina_WMDE & @tgr - all questions welcome, more infos: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Technical_Advice_IRC_Meeting  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [15:06:36] <Mandevil>	 When I do php -m, I don't see php ldap module loaded.  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [15:06:40] <Mandevil>	 But it's installed.  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [15:13:24] <Mandevil>	 Hm, there seems to be some confusion... I have php5 and php (which is 7.0).  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [15:13:35] <Mandevil>	 And LDAP extension is present only in the php5  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [15:17:00] <Mandevil>	 Yes, after installing php7.0-ldap I get ldap in php -m.  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [15:17:09] <Mandevil>	 But authentication still not working nor logging.  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [15:35:15] <Mandevil>	 oh, I finally got the logging work... here's what it says:  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [15:35:21] <Mandevil>	 2019-02-20 15:34:36 l5nets02 wiki: 2.1.0 It looks like you are missing LDAP support; please ensure you have either compiled LDAP support in, or have enabled the module. If the authentication is working for you, the plugin isn't properly detecting the LDAP module, and you can safely ignore this message.  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [15:36:21] <Mandevil>	 But LDAP support is there.  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [15:36:34] <Mandevil>	 root@l5nets02:/# php7.0 -m | grep ldap  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [15:36:35] <Mandevil>	 ldap  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [15:36:51] <Mandevil>	 root@l5nets02:/# php-cgi -m |  grep ldap  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [15:36:51] <Mandevil>	 ldap  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [15:51:18] <wm-bot>	 Technical Advice IRC meeting starting in 10 minutes in channel #wikimedia-tech, hosts: @Tonina_WMDE & @tgr - all questions welcome, more infos: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Technical_Advice_IRC_Meeting  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [17:09:30] <revansx[m]>	 dang .. just missed it  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [17:18:52] <bawolff>	 revansx[m]: Feel free to still ask questions outside of the office hours  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [17:22:30] <revansx[m]>	 ok. thanksbawolff bawolff .. here's a silly newb question.. is the #wikimedia-tech channel mentioned in the above link available here in RIOT?  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [17:22:54] <bawolff>	 Umm, good question. I haven't actually used riot, so I'm not sure  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [17:23:11] <bawolff>	 I assume there's a riot bridge to all freenode channels, but I don't really know how it works  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [17:24:29] <revansx[m]>	 my understanding is that riot is an IRC client in addition to other things.. does anyone know how I would find the #wikimedia-tech channel in riot?  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [17:28:42] <tgr>	 yeah, the matrix.org homeserver is bridged to all of Freenode  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [17:29:17] <tgr>	 I think the naming schema is something like #freenode_#wikimedia-tech:matrix.org?  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [17:29:52] <tgr>	 but if you just open the channel with the normal Riot UI, there will be a dropdown where you can select Freenode and then search for channels  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [17:29:56] <revansx[m]>	 yep! .. there it is. thanks!  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [20:31:24] <Sveta>	 emailuser is less rate limited for bots, right?  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [20:31:39] <Sveta>	 specifically what is the rate limit by default for non-bots?  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [20:31:58] <Sveta>	 i'm using the email facility to deliver people somewhat frequent notifications, and rate limiting is not being super helpful  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [20:36:10] <Skizzerz>	 have you tried Extension:MassMessage (delivers to talk pages, but users can enable email notifs for talk page changes), or Extension:MassMessageEmail ?  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [22:51:00] <Sveta>	 Skizzerz, i think it's installed, but we need personalised messages for each individual, does it allow that?  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [22:51:26] <Sveta>	 Skizzerz, i prepared individual text via a script externally  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [22:51:53] <Skizzerz>	 don't know if it does that, I've never used it personally  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [22:52:05] <Skizzerz>	 but... I don't think it does  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [22:52:37] <Sveta>	 right, hence the questions about the emailuser facility  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [22:53:59] <Skizzerz>	 seems to be 20 per 86400 seconds  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [22:54:06] <Skizzerz>	 bots don't inherently have a higher limit  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [22:55:31] <Skizzerz>	 if you have the 'noratelimit' right (in $wgGroupPermissions) you bypass that limit and can send however many emails you want  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [22:55:35] <Skizzerz>	 by default sysops have it  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [22:57:21] <Skizzerz>	 alternatively you can modify $wgRateLimits['emailuser']['user'] to modify the default for all logged-in users  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [23:00:11] <c>	 for the way mariadb works for storage, if it's on it's own dedicated space and it's reached "capacity" - when would raising the alloted space be needed if there are no issues with read/writes?   
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [23:00:23] <c>	 (for a mediawiki installation)  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [23:21:27] <Platonides>	 or $wgRateLimits['emailuser']['bot'] to modify the default for all bots  
mediawiki 2019-02-20 [23:21:58] <Platonides>	 c: what capacity are you talking about?  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [00:48:32] <k-man>	 in visual editor, how can i put a footnote in?  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [00:55:15] <bd808>	 k-man: Insert > More > Basic reference or type <ref  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [00:56:26] <k-man>	 i don't have Basic reference or type in that menu  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [00:56:40] <bd808>	 there's a keyboard shortcut too, but the mapping depends on your OS/browser. Hit the "?" menu item and select Keyboard shortcuts to see what it is (a+a+K on my macbook)  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [00:57:13] <k-man>	 ok  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [00:57:32] <k-man>	 so its ctrl+shift+k for me  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [00:58:29] <bd808>	 oh. Basic reference, or just type the literal string <ref in editing mode  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [00:58:55] <bd808>	 it should notice that and pop up the correct UI form  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [00:59:21] <bd808>	 just like typing {{ will open up the template insert dialog  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [00:59:25] <k-man>	 oh  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [00:59:53] <bd808>	 VE is kind of magic :)  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [01:00:22] <k-man>	 do i need a footnote template to have a footnote? I want a little [1] next to some text, then as a footnote, i want "[1] some foot note words"  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [01:01:22] <bd808>	 that should work without templates, but you will need to have the Cite extension installed I think  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [01:01:39] <bd808>	 https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Cite  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [01:02:51] <k-man>	 ok, its working  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [01:03:17] <k-man>	 of course the footnote wasn't showing up until i saved the page.  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [01:03:28] <bd808>	 :)  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [01:04:28] <k-man>	 so the formatting seems a bit off - it doesn't have any proper deliniation from the page content to the footnote content. As I have a numbered list at the end of the page, it looks odd  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [01:04:41] <k-man>	 is there a scratch mediawiki instance somewhere I can test it on?  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [01:04:53] <k-man>	 or sandbox  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [01:05:14] <bd808>	 https://test2.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [01:06:01] <bd808>	 but yeah, you have to style around the <references/> tag you insert yourself  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [01:07:16] <bd808>	 Usually I do "==References==" or something like that just before inserting <references/>  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [01:08:59] <k-man>	 ah ok  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [01:13:23] <k-man>	 nice tip, thanks bd808   
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [01:13:46] <k-man>	 i didn't haev a <references/> so i guess it just puts it at the end if you don't specificaly have that?  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [01:28:16] <k-man>	 is there a list of shortcuts for visual editor, like the <ref one? i just discovered == inserts a heading  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [01:28:29] <k-man>	 is there a shortcut to insert <references/> ?  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [02:14:33] <Sci>	 Hi, can anyone tell me what JSON files are?  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [05:22:37] <c>	 Platonides: in terms of a MariaDB instance on Amazon RDS  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [07:09:59] <extarys_>	 Sometimes while I'm in UploadWizard, on the last step where it adds the file with the description and everything, while it uploads files I get 'You must be logged in to upload this file.' even though I just logged on or refresh another page on the wiki to make sure my session is still active... did this happened to anyone?  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [09:30:50] <Sveta>	 extarys_: not to me  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [09:31:04] <Sveta>	 extarys_: but please report a bug at phabricator in case someone else reproduces it waaaay later  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [10:37:20] <spycrab0>	 Is there a system for installing extensions automatically?   
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [10:39:02] <Sveta>	 spycrab0: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:ExtensionDistributor ?  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [10:39:14] <Sveta>	 wait no sorry, forget it  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [10:40:19] <Sveta>	 spycrab0: i guess https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ManageWiki is maybe the best i know of  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [10:41:18] <spycrab0>	 I'll check that out thanks.  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [10:44:06] <spycrab0>	 Is there a way to get the latest wmf release over git? I mean I guess I could iterate over the tags but that seems cumbersome. So does manually updating every time.  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [10:54:18] <Sveta>	 if you are a developer, maybe mediawiki-vagrant is useful for you  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [10:55:04] <jonuru49>	 I tried to upgrade wiki to 1.31 from 1.30 and decided to revert because extensions weren't working, now this doesn't even seem to recognize itself  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [10:55:08] <jonuru49>	 https://wikizilla.org/wiki/Sanda  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [10:55:20] <jonuru49>	 Every page is a 404 error  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [10:55:49] <jonuru49>	 I restored the backup and then this happened. I don't know what to do.  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [11:07:00] <jonuru49>	 The 404 image there is from the /wiki/images so I assume the website's still there... but everything shows the 404 page....  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [15:25:29] <dsound>	 Hi! I have specific question about the Wikimedia API for a project app  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [15:26:04] <dsound>	 Is anyone here knowledgeable about the API? I've been messing around with the Sandbox and can't quite hone in on what I'm looking for  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [15:27:13] <dsound>	 I'm specifically making a song search app that gives links to the searched for songs and then if clicked, will give every possible detail about that song  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [15:29:16] <spycrab0>	 dsound: I think you might get more responses in #mediawiki-dev  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [15:29:40] <dsound>	 thank you!  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [15:30:55] <bawolff>	 #mediawiki-dev is not a channel?  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [15:31:25] <Skizzerz>	 it is not, it forwards to #wikimedia-dev  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [15:31:36] <bawolff>	 #wikimedia-tech is probably the channel that spycrab0 meant  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [15:31:54] <bawolff>	 #wikimedia-dev would also be a poor channel for dsound's question  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [15:31:57] <Skizzerz>	 in any case, help with the API is likely best suited for this channel  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [15:32:34] <spycrab0>	 Oh sorry, I misremembered the channel name :/  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [15:33:29] <Skizzerz>	 dsound: your main issue is that the API can fetch page contents and do general searches, but data in wiki pages is largely unstructured. Wikidata is a project to expose that better, and you can see if your songs have any data items on wikidata that you could query. Otherwise you're mostly limited to parsing the infobox template or whatnot to extract the info from page text  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [15:33:45] <spycrab0>	 dsound: This is page is definitely something you want to look at if you haven't already: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [15:33:59] <Skizzerz>	 (which is prone to failure)  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [15:34:01] <spycrab0>	 +1 for wikidata :)  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [15:34:02] <bawolff>	 dsound: checkout query.wikidata.org for being able to do SPARQL queries against wikidata  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [15:34:36] <bawolff>	 It really depends, do you just want a summary - in which case you could probably use the extracts api module to get like the first paragraph description from wikipedia  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [15:34:48] <bawolff>	 Otherwise, definitely checkout wikidata, for facts on an individual level  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [15:38:20] <spycrab0>	 There are even quite a few music related examples in there.  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [15:39:16] <bawolff>	 Be warned, SPARQL has a tad bit of a learning curve, especially if you are not familar with the semantic web model  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [16:10:52] <jayso>	 hello  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:07:57] <scribuntoProblem>	 just a vague hope: does anybody use the scribunto extension in termux? I can't get it to work  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:13:05] <bawolff>	 If you describe whatever issue your having, maybe someone will know the answer  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:35:48] <scribuntoProblem>	 I'm not sure myself. When running with nornal standalonelua I get 'Syntax Error "(" unexpected' on all templates using scribunto. Using a lua installation leads to 'libreadline.so.7 not found'. I have no clue how to go on, since I neither have an idea how to make scribunto log more than the errorlog nor what is wrong with my libreadline.  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:36:46] <scribuntoProblem>	 I was vaguely hoping for someone using scribunto and saying 'haha, there's a simple catch'  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:39:10] <Reedy>	 What OS?  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:40:30] <scribuntoProblem>	 android 7  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:41:02] <Reedy>	 Uh  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:41:09] <Reedy>	 How are you even trying to use scribunto on android?  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:41:19] <scribuntoProblem>	 Termux busybox  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:42:55] <scribuntoProblem>	 It..works quite well, but not well enough yet. And I don't really want to take the step of installing linux yet  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:42:59] * Reedy scratches his head  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:43:30] <Reedy>	 Can you install libreadline in your package manager?  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:43:44] <bawolff>	 When you say "lua installation" what does that mean?  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:43:55] <bawolff>	 is that using lua from your package manager?  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:44:09] <scribuntoProblem>	 Using the lua binary from the package manager, yes  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:44:09] <Reedy>	 https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Package_Management  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:44:19] <bawolff>	 Well actually, i guess you must, as i assume android is on arm and we don't bundle an arm version  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:44:53] <Reedy>	 https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/tree/master/packages/readline  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:44:57] <Reedy>	 Definitely seems to be packages  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:44:59] <N3X15>	 You're probably going to have to compile everything yourself, if I'm being honest  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:45:09] <scribuntoProblem>	 any os I install will be arm still, since arm is the hardware  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:45:16] <N3X15>	 This is kinda uncharted territory  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:45:35] <scribuntoProblem>	 So..learning curve ahead, thank you for the warning  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:46:05] <Reedy>	 Try installing readline 7 in the meantime, it looks like that's what they're packaging  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:46:17] <Reedy>	 Also, based on above... This is very much unsupported  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:46:44] <scribuntoProblem>	 I already have it installed :/ and thank you for bearing with me  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:46:46] <Reedy>	 heh

mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:46:52] <Reedy>	 "This SO question seems relevant. Apparently, the lua binary included with Scribunto is not ok with Raspberry Pi, which may be a similar problem with a synology.  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:46:53] <Reedy>	 Basically, try to install lua from your distribution and set $wgScribuntoEngineConf['luastandalone']['luaPath'] to the path of the lua executable and see if that works."

mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:48:29] <scribuntoProblem>	 did it, was source of the libreadline missing/not being linkable error.  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:49:39] <bawolff>	 Guess we should fix the error message. "syntax error: unexpected "("" is a terrible error for architecture not supported  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:50:11] <Reedy>	 Well, that's not our fault :P  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:50:21] <Reedy>	 That's just the underlying issue from trying to run the binary  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:50:39] <scribuntoProblem>	 I'm happy to have an explanation at least :)  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:51:00] <Reedy>	 computers suck?  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:51:44] <bawolff>	 Dependency management in particular sucks ;)  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:52:18] <bawolff>	 scribuntoProblem: Did you try installing readline package?  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:54:38] <scribuntoProblem>	 bawolff: I have the stable version installed  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:54:45] <scribuntoProblem>	 Didn't try dev yet  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:54:53] <bawolff>	 Do you know what version?  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:55:06] <bawolff>	 key thing is you need version 7  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:55:24] <Reedy>	 well, dev doesn't mean it's not stable  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:55:32] <scribuntoProblem>	 I got 7.0.5-2  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:55:45] <scribuntoProblem>	 Dev means it may or may be not stable  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:55:50] <Reedy>	 No  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:55:54] <Reedy>	 -dev usually means things like headers and stuff that are useful for debugging  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:56:13] <scribuntoProblem>	 I got a libreadline.so.7 in my lib folder, so all seams great  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:56:17] <Reedy>	 A dev package is different from a dev branch  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:56:21] <bawolff>	 scribuntoProblem: Well if you have that, its probably a path issue I would guess. For some reason its looking for libreadline in the wrong place  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [18:57:21] <scribuntoProblem>	 Thats kind of a good idea, since busybox paths are messed up  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [19:00:32] <scribuntoProblem>	 Reedy: I'm clueless concerning the ecosystem: a dev-package is nothing in  development but something aimed at developers?  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [19:01:12] <bawolff>	 scribuntoProblem: Its for when you are writing your own programs  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [19:01:42] <bawolff>	 typically -dev packages contain header files, which are neccesary if you want to create new programs that are using the library  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [19:03:02] <bawolff>	 so the hacky way to fix your issue, would be to figure out where its looking for libraries, and symlink libreadline.so.7 there  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [19:04:07] <scribuntoProblem>	 So..you did the easy part of the solution :/ I'm yet to figure out where it is looking  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [19:04:26] <scribuntoProblem>	 Header files are like the *.h interfaces in c ?  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [19:04:43] <bawolff>	 yes  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [19:04:46] <scribuntoProblem>	 And please shout at me if its too offtopic  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [19:08:58] <bawolff>	 Its fine in this channel, but you may get better answers at a support forum for your specific OS, as its really a question about your OS package manager  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [19:09:56] <scribuntoProblem>	 You already made me atleast understand my problem  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [19:11:13] <scribuntoProblem>	 Currently I just want to use the foreach template, so if all fails I can fall back to php. Even if I wasted more characters on the problem than I would have to repeat  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:13:03] <itsallmyfault>	 Just a shimmer of notunderstanding again. Mediawiki is a bunch of scripts for a httpd demon.. how does it bite down on my operating system that hard?  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:14:47] <bawolff>	 itsallmyfault: Because abstractions are fun!  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:15:19] <Skizzerz>	 it's also not exactly a lightweight application  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:15:20] <itsallmyfault>	 I'm all for abstraction  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:15:54] <itsallmyfault>	 I just hate myself for missing the php and linux train  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:16:04] <Skizzerz>	 rendering any given page involves issuing about a dozen db queries (or over a hundred if you're using db to cache i18n messages)  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:16:38] <Skizzerz>	 on top of that, there's a lot of string parsing and manipulation, both of page content as well as other stuff to get it to display  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:17:08] <bawolff>	 I mean, if you setup profiling, I could tell you in detail what's taking so much resources  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:17:09] <Skizzerz>	 plus the file IO to load its hundreds of php files  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:17:48] <Skizzerz>	 (since you probably aren't using opcode caching, or if you are, it may be way too constrained with available RAM to be useful)  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:18:25] <itsallmyfault>	 Thats a result of the classic stateful vs stateless services debate.. and not an issue of technology  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:18:40] <Skizzerz>	 it's an issue of resources  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:19:10] <Skizzerz>	 a high-performance webserver or db server will have oodles of memory available to use for caching, so that things don't have to make it to PHP or the db server or whatever if they don't absolutely have to  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:19:39] <itsallmyfault>	 So the webserver is like an oracle?  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:19:50] <Skizzerz>	 no?  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:20:16] <Skizzerz>	 just RAM is faster than hard disk, and fetching pre-made results is faster than asking the app to dynamically create it all over again  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:20:41] <itsallmyfault>	 But it relies on 'same request->same output:'  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:20:56] <Skizzerz>	 yes, the application tells the server what aspects of the web page (if any) are cacheable  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:21:20] <bawolff>	 But it caches parts of things, and then does later things with it  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:21:44] <bawolff>	 If you want to compare it to a hash oracle, varnish would be the relavent layer  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:22:16] <itsallmyfault>	 I missed a whole lot of stuff:/  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:22:42] <Skizzerz>	 tl;dr don't expect to get good performance when running a webserver on your phone or table  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:22:45] <Skizzerz>	 *tablet  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:23:08] <bawolff>	 In particular, MW is generally optimized for a big powerful webserver environment  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:23:27] <bawolff>	 When there are tradeoffs to be made performance wise, it took the choice that makes the most sense for a big server deployment  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:24:22] <bawolff>	 Not to say you can't optimize it for small-form devices...but its definitely not the target audiance  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:24:42] <itsallmyfault>	 I understand that path. But for me, mediawiki provides great support for personal notes.  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:25:47] <bawolff>	 That's good. Even if optimized for the big server case, we aim to make sure it still works decently on smaller things  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:26:36] <itsallmyfault>	 Just to make sure: it does. I just have an issue with a small subset of templates  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:27:12] <bawolff>	 If your on a resource constrained device, there's probably a lot of stuff to do with optimizing caching layer that can help with performance. As probably suddenly you can't store it all, but you could probably make choices over which types of cache are more important then others  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:27:30] <bawolff>	 But that's definitely a bunch of work, and something you'd have to guide with profiling  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:28:21] <bawolff>	 As an aside, for personal notes, some people really like tiddlywiki https://tiddlywiki.com/  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:29:34] <itsallmyfault>	 I tried that too, but mediawiki has the structure of wikipedia, so every person is already familiar to it  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:29:45] <bawolff>	 Woo, world domination!  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:30:12] <itsallmyfault>	 Tiddlywiki is great! But not great enough.  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:31:19] <itsallmyfault>	 oh gosh. My wiki is aimed at other developers  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:33:08] <bawolff>	 btw, if you want to go down the rabbit hole of performance optimization, see https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Profiling  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:35:14] <itsallmyfault>	 I'm a professional developer in mainframes, so even talking about using megabytes of ram blows my mind. Currently I don't experience any performance issues on the 1gb tablet running my wiki and the browser  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:36:01] <bawolff>	 Something something, kids these days and their ram hungry ways ;)  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:40:04] <itsallmyfault>	 Its a fpm interpreting a couple of thousand lines of php  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:40:14] <itsallmyfault>	 Cant be that bad  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:45:02] <niso>	 Hi, Anyone know any tool that can change the formatting of page wikicode like described here: https://pastebin.com/H2ZVRAbs (like prettyprint), ty   
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:46:43] <Skizzerz>	 anything could regex something like that  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:47:45] <niso>	 I'm looking for something written that does that (Can write that with pywikibot, but checking before)  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:49:48] <Skizzerz>	 but, those aren't the same thing semantically; the extra line breaks can cause issues in certain cases  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:50:05] <Skizzerz>	 (notably, if you're using implicit/unnamed template parameters)  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:51:14] <niso>	 You mean that the param would be "first\n"?  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:53:09] <Skizzerz>	 perhaps it'd be easier to explain by way of example  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:54:54] <Skizzerz>	 https://dpaste.de/FfJk  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:55:08] <Skizzerz>	 so as long as you're using named params, you're safe  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:55:22] <Skizzerz>	 the moment you go into using {{{1}}}, {{{2}}} and the like, the newlines in the template call matter  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [20:58:36] <niso>	 tried that, and got you, why that? the param value may be parse at the same way no?  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [21:00:11] <Skizzerz>	 no, because the "pretty-print" version has newlines at the end of each param value  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [21:00:27] <Skizzerz>	 those newlines are NOT stripped when using implicit (unnamed) parameters  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [21:00:38] <Skizzerz>	 but they are stripped when using named parameters  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [21:03:15] <Skizzerz>	 niso: see https://www.thetestwiki.org/wiki/Sandbox for a demo  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [21:03:39] <Skizzerz>	 so, any script you end up using will need to ensure it only does the pretty-printing for named params  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [21:07:44] <niso>	 yea, ive tested that on my wiki also, ty. but why this is the case for unamed params? they cannot be treated (without showing the user) as named params with indexing? in your exmaple just add "|1=Test|2=cat"?  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [21:08:56] <Skizzerz>	 niso: I don't know the reasoning, it's just how it is. The moment you name the params (and you can always name a param, even if it's a number), it strips newlines  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [21:09:11] <niso>	 ty!  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [21:10:51] <bawolff>	 I think its a backcompat thing  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [21:11:30] <bawolff>	 The idea to kill whitespace came later, and named parameters were introduced later  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [21:11:35] <bawolff>	 maybe  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [21:12:23] <Skizzerz>	 that's likely the case  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [21:39:17] <spycrab0>	 Heh, just ended up writing a mediawiki extension manager in python :P  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [22:10:03] <extarys_>	 Is there a way to delete files in batch?  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [22:10:11] <extarys_>	 Or UploadWizard to overwrite existing images with a new version?  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [23:42:18] <extarys_>	 How can I add bootstrap of foundation to help make nice pages? :P  
mediawiki 2019-02-21 [23:51:16] <tgr>	 extarys_: there is a bootstrap skin  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [00:38:36] <N3X15>	 Updated NativeSVG or those that need it.  https://gitlab.com/N3X15/mediawiki-extension-NativeSvgHandler  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [00:38:49] <N3X15>	 Uses the new extension.json stuff.  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [00:46:18] <elmerg>	 Man, I wish setting up shorturls was simpler...   
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:06:30] <extarys_>	 N3X15: :D Awesome  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:06:58] <elmerg>	 Anyone here ever tried to set up shorturls on digitalocean, or even CentOS 7 running apache httpd?  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:07:02] <extarys_>	 If you ever have time to make TitleIcon not rely on semantic :D  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:07:25] <N3X15>	 I'll look at it later.  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:07:36] <N3X15>	 For now, time to cook spaghetti~  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:07:51] <extarys_>	 MIAM!  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:07:57] <extarys_>	 GitLab <3 FTW  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:08:18] <elmerg>	 I can get the rewrite to work, but all I get is a not found error.  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:08:49] <extarys_>	 elmerg: do you have a link to your config?  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:08:56] <von-strauss>	 are you guys going to port this to node or something  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:08:58] <extarys_>	 I'm not a pro though I had a lot of issues myself  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:09:28] <extarys_>	 von-strauss: That would be awesome I agree but I don't think so, PHP is reliable in this case, porting to node would take a lot of time  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:10:06] <elmerg>	 One sec, let me throw it into a paste.  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:10:10] <extarys_>	 von-strauss: I use a lot of software written in PHP using MySQL and I wish I could use them in node with rethinkdb or couchdb  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:10:12] <von-strauss>	 you can develop stuff idiomatic javascript a lot faster than the corresponding PHP  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:10:44] <von-strauss>	 a team of four competent devs could get a feature parity mediawiki clone in MEAN in a matter of weeks  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:13:55] <elmerg>	 extarys: https://pastebin.com/7PW3nFWS  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:15:04] <extarys_>	 elmerg: I think you also need to add $wgUsePathInfo      = true;, but I don't think the error is coming from that  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:16:20] <extarys_>	 elmerg: your /mw redirect to /wiki, but your apache configuration is for mw  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:16:48] <extarys_>	 you may need to change this line : $wgArticlePath = "/wiki/$1";  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:17:22] <elmerg>	 OK. What do I change it to?  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:17:56] <extarys_>	 $wgArticlePath = "/mw/$1";  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:18:05] <elmerg>	 I thought that articlepath was what it should be rewriting to?  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:18:25] <extarys_>	 Its rewritten to wiki, but your apache config is for mw  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:19:00] <elmerg>	 OK. So I changed it, and still Not Found error. The Requested URL wiki/Main_Page was not found on this server.  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:19:42] <elmerg>	 ER, /wiki/Main_Page  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:21:15] <elmerg>	 I have all the rewrite instances set to All in httpd.conf and I've restarted the server twice.  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:21:28] <extarys_>	 My old one was this https://pastebin.com/zgkXyq6Y  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:21:41] <extarys_>	 I switched to nginx though on a vps  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:21:51] <extarys_>	 the old setup was a local test server  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:22:48] <extarys_>	 Note it was at the root though  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:23:49] <elmerg>	 Yeah. I'm not a sysadmin by any stretch, and I used to be able to do this with no issues on shared hosting via .htaccess. Could this be because the thing is set up as a virtual host?  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:35:56] <elmerg>	 I just don't want to start over, since i have hosts and stuff already set up on CentOS and I have a MUSH server that runs best on CentOS.   
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:45:39] <elmerg>	 I guess the other question is, am I putting this in the right host? I'm putting it in sites-available, should it be going into the conf in sites-enabled?  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:48:45] <Skizzerz>	 best practice is put it in sites-available, then a2ensite (I think that's the command) to "enable" that site (which creates a symlink in sites-enabled)  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:49:20] <elmerg>	 *nod*  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:49:32] <elmerg>	 WEll, I've undone my changes so I'm back to site.com/mw/index.php/Main_Page  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:49:46] <Skizzerz>	 ok, lemme read up to see what your actual issue is  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:50:08] <Skizzerz>	 so you're trying to set up short urls?  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:51:26] <elmerg>	 Yes.  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:51:31] <Skizzerz>	 elmerg: head to https://mwusers.org/apps/pretty-url-generator and put in what your URLs currently look like and what you'd want them to look like (see the placeholder text for examples)  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:51:40] <Skizzerz>	 that should spit out the config to use  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:52:56] <elmerg>	 Okay. But can I use .htaccess with a virtual host?  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:52:58] <Skizzerz>	 let me know if you're having issues or it doesn't work (I wrote that app a while ago)  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:53:01] <Skizzerz>	 yes  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:53:17] <Skizzerz>	 in the vhost config just add in "AllowOverride All" if it's not already there  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:53:40] <elmerg>	 I have tried all options that the redwerks shorturl builder spits out, both for htaccess and root access, and I constantly can only get the 404 Not Found error (with it successfully rewriting the /wiki/ directory).  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:54:06] <Skizzerz>	 (if there's a line in the vhost config that's like AllowOverride None, remove that. Also remove all rewrite rules and Alias directives from the vhost config)  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:54:35] <Skizzerz>	 I personally recommend having the rewrites in .htaccess instead of apache config because they're a lot easier to change in .htaccess, and it keeps it "local" to your site's files instead of having to remember it's in the apache config file  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:55:03] <elmerg>	 Well, I have some rewrite stuff in there that seems to have to do with my SSL?  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:55:17] <elmerg>	 AT least in the apache config.   
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:55:26] <elmerg>	 I'll add in the AllowOverride All, which is not in there though.  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:55:35] <Skizzerz>	 try removing that. For mediawiki you can force SSL by setting $wgServer to a https url  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:55:47] <Skizzerz>	 AllowOverride All is what lets .htaccess work; without it, .htaccess will not do anything  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:57:59] <elmerg>	 OK. My directory is /var/www/hotbmush/public_html, do I just drop the .htaccess in there?   
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [01:58:17] <elmerg>	 And /mw/ is the directory for the wiki, obvs.  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [02:03:38] <elmerg>	 So I did what you requested. I'm getting a 500 Interanl SErver Error, misconfiguration notice.   
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [02:10:33] <elmerg>	 Skizzers: So yeah, that iddn't work.  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [02:11:11] <Skizzerz>	 ok what's in your error log?  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [02:12:11] <elmerg>	 Which error log? As I said earlier, I'm not quite a server admin by any stretch.   
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [02:13:08] <elmerg>	 Also I got a systemctl restart error after I added the AllowOverride All in the virtual host, which went away after I removed it.  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [02:13:24] <elmerg>	 AT this point, I feel like I"m just going to have to deal with the long URLs.   
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [04:57:17] <setian>	 do most mediawiki devs use vagrant for their environment?  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [05:01:03] <andre__>	 https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/How_to_become_a_MediaWiki_hacker lists the options.  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [05:01:11] <andre__>	 Not sure we have statistics what "most devs" do.  
mediawiki 2019-02-22 [05:18:03] <setian>	 andre_: oh, okay, I was just thinking, "when in Rome..."

mediawiki 2019-02-22 [13:31:13] <Reedy>	 With some other extensions, or using Lua/Scribunto? Probably

mediawiki 2019-02-23 [00:42:48] <dsound>	 Could someone help me with the Mediawiki API?  
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [00:43:40] <dsound>	 I'm messing with the sandbox and can't get the parameters needed to return a list of search results with titles and url's to the actual page. It only returns title, snippet and pageid  
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [00:43:59] <dsound>	 an image would be nice too  
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [00:47:29] <tgr>	 dsound: not sure if there is a good way to do that  
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [00:47:45] <tgr>	 you can use generator=search, but then you don't get the snippet  
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [00:49:10] <dsound>	 I don't really need the snippet. I just need a user to be able to search a song title, submit then get results matching those titles with url's to the main wiki page about the song  
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [00:50:42] <dsound>	 Like if there are many songs called 'Love', it would return all results of existing songs called 'love' and the user can choose from the results and it will take them to a details page.   
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [00:51:41] <MaxSem>	 dsound: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:ApiSandbox#action=query&format=json&prop=info&generator=search&inprop=url&gsrsearch=foo  
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [00:51:56] <MaxSem>	 Basically, use search as a generator for info  
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [01:02:20] <dsound>	 @MaxSem YES!!! THAT'S THE ONE!!!  
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [02:31:13] <N3X15>	 JSON really needs comment support.  
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [02:54:36] <setian_>	 hi, is there a reason why on one machine, a describe statement would make a field show up as varchar, and on another it would show up as varbinary?  
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [02:55:02] <setian_>	 assuming they're both using mariadb  
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [02:55:18] <setian_>	 and the same mediawiki version  
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [02:59:57] <MaxSem>	 setian_: $wgDBmysql5

mediawiki 2019-02-23 [03:45:47] <bangiras394>	 Hello, I restored from a backup & this notice is stubbornly refusing to go away. https://wikizilla.org/wiki/Special:RecentChanges -- I have already fixed the line it's talking about: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Topic:U6733lwyzrvcih7q  --- turning off error notifications on the .htaccess on public_html & the .htaccess on /wiki/ . I've set $wgShowExceptionDetails to false. There is no error_reporting( -1); in there either.  
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [03:46:19] <andre__>	 which "this notice"?  
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [03:47:00] <bangiras394>	 Notice: Undefined variable: type in /.../public_html/wiki/extensions/HeadScript/HeadScript.php on line 3  
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [03:47:02] <bangiras394>	 On top  
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [04:10:08] <p858snake>	 bangiras394: I would consider disabling that extesnion, it doesn't appear to be updated since 2015 so i wouldn't be surprised its broken against 1.30.X  
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [04:13:26] <bangiras394>	 This wiki has been 1.30 for months and it's worked. Only after upgrading to 1.31 (which long story short I had to revert from a backup back to 1.30) is it now continuing to show this error...  
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [04:15:23] <bangiras394>	 Commenting out the require_once "$IP/extensions/HeadScript/HeadScript.php"; doesn't seem to work either, or it's taking very long. A lot of extensions seem to have broken after restoring the backup  
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [04:16:28] <bangiras394>	 I overwrote all the extensions with 1.30 versions so if there were any differences between their 1.31 and 1.30 versions, that shouldn't be a problem.  
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [04:19:16] <bangiras394>	 SocialProfile and Comments seem to work. HeadScript, Popups, MsUpload, WikiEditor, references popping up when you hover over them, are examples of extensions which no longer work (and didn't work either when I tried to upgrade to 1.31 AND overwrote those with their apparently 1.31 versions according to extension distributor)  
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [04:23:02] <bangiras394>	 And that's all nice and problematic, but more pressingly I urgently need the notice being shown on the top of the site to be hidden away since that's very bad. It looks like the wiki is ignoring turning off errors in LocalSettings, the .htaccess files, php.ini ... even trying to make every page redirect to a 503.php page is being ignored  
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [04:26:57] <bangiras394>	 *I believe the HeadScript extension <is> working, since on mobile Chrome the site is still showing a colored bar and etc. I added with it, but the error is persistent and doesn't want to go away.  
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [05:35:04] <bangiras394>	 Ok well I posted the persistent notice security issue problem on project help desk if anyone would like to help at a different time https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Topic:Uuqa8kbamxqxwffw

mediawiki 2019-02-23 [21:59:28] <Lycurgus>	 you should say what versions of mediawiki it works with  
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [22:01:18] <Lycurgus>	 o i c, latest master  
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [22:01:58] <Lycurgus>	 with all those limitations and being python it's not likely to get much play  
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [22:02:26] <Lycurgus>	 peoples want they pkg mgr things to be stronk  
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [22:02:44] <v5admin>	 Need some help. I'm trying to use the 3rd party DPL extension. For some reason, when I install it, it doesn't show my edit button on any pages. It also doesn't seem to have auto-generated the associated template.  
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [22:04:26] <spycrab0>	 Lycurgus: At the moment it's more of a pet project anyway.  
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [22:04:56] <Lycurgus>	 people expect a pkgmgr for a thing to run in that thing  
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [22:05:20] <Lycurgus>	 which is why pip is in python and not haskell or js  
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [22:10:58] <v5admin>	 I also seem to get this error when trying to manually edit it via putting in the edit link.  
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [22:11:01] <v5admin>	  The action you have requested is limited to users in the group: Users.  
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [22:24:26] <v5admin>	 Anyone?   
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [22:30:33] <v5admin>	 Aha, I got it. Apparently something is causing it not to generate the DPL template. Manually making it,then enabling the extension worked. Sheisty workaround, but...   
mediawiki 2019-02-23 [22:45:59] <N3X15>	 I made a mediawiki installer and package manager as well, the only difference is that mine is a mess :V

mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:20:54] <N_tonio36>	 i'm facing a little problem with the mediawiki api, i own a wiki bot which cannot upload files  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:21:21] <N_tonio36>	 and the error isn't an object, it's like the html source code of the wiki's api page, so it isn't quite helpful  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:21:51] <N_tonio36>	 i use the nodejs "mwbot" library, if it's any help  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:23:19] <harmaahylje>	 it would probably help if you'd tell what is it that you are trying to do, and what the error message is  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:24:04] <N_tonio36>	 uploading a file through a bot  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:24:45] <harmaahylje>	 to what mediawiki version  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:26:31] <N_tonio36>	 1.31.1  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:26:34] <andre__>	 Please provide clear and exact steps to reproduce. And if there is an error, please provide the exact error.  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:27:48] <N_tonio36>	 1) install nodejs and with it, the mwbot module 2) login as a bot account through the module 3) attempt to upload a file  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:29:17] <Vulpix>	 N_tonio36: Did you see the HTML returned by the error? What kind of error is it? Maybe it's not MediaWiki, but an error generated or masked by the webserver itself  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:29:43] <N_tonio36>	 i'll create a text file of the error   
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:31:42] <N_tonio36>	 https://ufile.io/refv8  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:32:10] <N_tonio36>	 the wiki is french, mind you

mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:34:53] <Vulpix>	 PokApAdia, I know this one ;)  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:34:54] <harmaahylje>	 looks like it gives you somekind of API help page  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:35:08] <N_tonio36>	 yup, it is the API help page  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:35:38] <Vulpix>	 Does it happen with every upload, or only a particular file?  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:35:44] <N_tonio36>	 every upload  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:35:50] <N_tonio36>	 literally, every single upload  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:35:51] <harmaahylje>	 does your bot work otherwise?  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:35:54] <N_tonio36>	 yup  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:36:03] <harmaahylje>	 what endpoint are you using to upload files?  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:36:12] <N_tonio36>	 pokepedia.fr/api.php  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:36:20] <N_tonio36>	 basically the same as everything else  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:36:28] <N_tonio36>	 as every other task, i mean  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:37:19] <harmaahylje>	 You've probably read this, right? https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Upload  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:37:48] <N_tonio36>	 yup i did  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:38:20] <harmaahylje>	 do you have that token present?  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:38:27] <N_tonio36>	 yup  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:38:42] <N_tonio36>	 or else it would clearly tell me that i need a token for my requests  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:38:50] <Vulpix>	 Be sure the endpoint is, exactly "https://www.pokepedia.fr/api.php". If you miss the www. prefix, or you're not using https:, the server may force you a redirect and you lose the POSTed data  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:38:52] <N_tonio36>	 (at least the error would be a clear one xA)  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:39:21] <N_tonio36>	 it is exactly as mentioned, https://www.pokepedia.fr/api.php  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:39:44] <harmaahylje>	 could it be disabled, file upload?  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:39:57] <N_tonio36>	 file uploads aren't disabled, no  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:40:32] <N_tonio36>	 the bot also has the rights of an identified user, including uploading files, so it's not a permission issue  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:40:52] <Vulpix>	 In the api, any error or permission problem would give a error message with the chosen api format, either json or xml, not the HTML representation of it  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:40:54] <harmaahylje>	 well that help page certainly is not helpful.  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:41:04] <N_tonio36>	 my point exactly ^^"  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:41:28] <Vulpix>	 It looks like the server is either doing a redirect to the api main page, or discarding all parameters/POST data  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:41:44] <Vulpix>	 ...or there's a bug with the bot not sending them  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:41:54] <N_tonio36>	 not quite  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:42:20] <N_tonio36>	 i've printed the sent request to the console, it does include the parameters/post data, with the file content and whatnot  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:42:56] <N_tonio36>	 but if it's a server problem, shouldn't it mean that literally anyone can't upload files, bot or human?  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:43:29] <Vulpix>	 Can you get the response from the server, without automatically following redirects? Just to be sure it doesn't send you a HTTP 302 response that redirects the bot to the api main page  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:43:58] <Vulpix>	 The problem may be only on the api. Normal web uploads are not handled by the api  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:44:39] <N_tonio36>	 i see  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:49:21] <N_tonio36>	 i'll try intercepting the server replies, it's gonna take some time tho  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:49:27] <N_tonio36>	 hope you don't mind  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:49:29] <N_tonio36>	 ^^"  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [19:49:37] <Vulpix>	 no problem  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:00:57] <N_tonio36>	 any other way we could try to debug? i'm not quite able to do it :s  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:01:56] <harmaahylje>	 what does the response say?  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:02:37] <N_tonio36>	 i wasn't able to intercept it ^^"  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:02:47] <N_tonio36>	 sorry, i messed up big time i know  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:02:53] <harmaahylje>	 no you did not  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:03:12] <harmaahylje>	 can you show the code? maybe we can help  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:06:40] <N_tonio36>	 oh interesting  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:06:54] <N_tonio36>	 guess the way to intercept incoming responses was right under my nose ^^"  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:07:18] <N_tonio36>	 alright so i tried a functioning query, and it showed me a proper server response  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:07:25] <N_tonio36>	 i'll pastebin it for reference  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:09:02] <N_tonio36>	 https://pastebin.com/k3fqLA7R sensitive details hidden, this is what i get when i login  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:10:41] <N_tonio36>	 aaaaaaaaaaand https://pastebin.com/Suw0XXjk straight from the server  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:10:55] <N_tonio36>	 yet again, it's the mediawiki api reference  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:10:57] <N_tonio36>	 --'  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:12:07] <harmaahylje>	 well your example doesn't show any params  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:12:18] <harmaahylje>	 also topic suggests to use dpaste.de  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:12:55] <N_tonio36>	 well, as i said, it was just a login  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:13:42] <N_tonio36>	 allow me to sidetrack just a bit, but what's the difference between pastebin and dpaste?  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:13:45] <harmaahylje>	 so what does the request for file uploads hold  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:14:17] <harmaahylje>	 the other one shows ads  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:14:38] <N_tonio36>	 mm fine  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:14:48] <harmaahylje>	 can you paste the request object?  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:14:55] <N_tonio36>	 alright  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:15:02] <harmaahylje>	 when you try to upload  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:16:26] <N_tonio36>	 side note, when i try to upload, the answer comes as a http request 200 code  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:16:38] <N_tonio36>	 with, you guessed it, the whole html deal  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:16:45] <N_tonio36>	 200, not 302, strangely  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:19:07] <N_tonio36>	 https://dpaste.de/i7VW for the outgoing request  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:19:07] <N_tonio36>	 enable word wrap  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:24:51] <harmaahylje>	 "name":"token","value":false}  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:25:15] <N_tonio36>	 ..... oh  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:25:54] <harmaahylje>	 Gotta go to sleep, I hope you solve this problem!  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:26:07] <N_tonio36>	 cya, thanks ^^  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:28:04] <N_tonio36>	 well uh  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:28:31] <N_tonio36>	 it hopelessly didn't work, even with a login before the upload attempt  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:28:58] <N_tonio36>	 login + token obtaining  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:30:42] <Vulpix>	 Can you try debugging requests, with https://www.npmjs.com/package/request#debugging ?, the dpaste you posted seems to contain pre- or post-processed data wich may not be what is really going to the server  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:33:07] <N_tonio36>	 the dpaste is indeed the pre-processed data  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:33:15] <N_tonio36>	 i'll do as you suggested  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:37:42] <N_tonio36>	 https://dpaste.de/dGig  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:37:51] <N_tonio36>	 server answer  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:41:30] <N_tonio36>	 as you can see, it's a 200 status code, not 302  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:41:49] <Vulpix>	 N_tonio36: uh, be sure to log out inmediately, I forgot to say to remove the cookies from the request/response, which are there  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:42:58] <N_tonio36>	 i trust you don't mess with the cookies :)  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:43:21] <N_tonio36>	 but i'll remove them if that's a really big deal  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:44:07] <Vulpix>	 Just log out and log in again  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:44:14] <Vulpix>	 That will make that cookie invalid  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:44:22] <N_tonio36>	 okay  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:44:41] <Vulpix>	 I see the problem here: The bot is sending content with "content-type":"application/x-www-form-urlencoded"  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:44:52] <Vulpix>	 It should be multipart/form-data instead  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:45:58] <Vulpix>	 Are you overriding it? Apparently by default it's set correctly https://github.com/Fannon/mwbot/blob/master/src/index.js#L632  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:46:18] <N_tonio36>	 i don't remember touching it, but i'll double check  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:48:18] <N_tonio36>	 are content-type and mimeType different things?  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:50:07] <Vulpix>	 I guess requests translates one to the other  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:50:23] <Vulpix>	 (Note: I've never developed with nodejs)  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:52:05] <N_tonio36>	 as far as i can tell, the line you've shown matches what i currently have  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:52:52] <N_tonio36>	 give me some time, i have some digging to do  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:53:08] <Vulpix>	 Oh, I mean if you passed a different content/type mimetype from the code that calls this  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:53:30] <N_tonio36>	 well, nope  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:54:50] <N_tonio36>	 but that "content-type": "application-whatever" actually piqued (if that's a word) my interest  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:55:14] <N_tonio36>	 i just have to find where does it get set, so i can override it into the proper value  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:55:42] <N_tonio36>	 probably an ugly hack but it should work  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:56:15] <Vulpix>	 maybe something changed in the requests library for that header, and mwbot hasn't been updated  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [20:59:51] <N_tonio36>	 the content-type header should be set just like the user-agent, right?  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [21:00:29] <N_tonio36>	 like { method: 'POST', headers: { "content-type": "multipart/form-data", "User-Agent": "mwbot/whatever")}}  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [21:00:42] <N_tonio36>	 don't mind the ), typo  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [21:01:34] <Vulpix>	 yes, it's a header. However, it also changes how the data is sent to the server. I'm not sure if the requests library will automatically convert that for you or needs an explicit parameter  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [21:02:02] <N_tonio36>	 well, i just printed out the outgoing request, aaand it only has the user agent set  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [21:02:22] <N_tonio36>	 on my level, at least  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [21:02:40] <N_tonio36>	 my guess is that it gets set by default to application/x-whatever   
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [21:02:41] <Vulpix>	 actually, seems to be a matter of what parameter name you use to send the data: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49053193/nodejs-request-how-to-send-multipart-form-data-post-request  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [21:03:15] <N_tonio36>	 oh  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [21:03:18] <N_tonio36>	 interesting  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [21:12:54] <N_tonio36>	 alright so i got dirty and tried a workaround to include the proper content-type and follow the SO answer  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [21:13:20] <N_tonio36>	 and now, for the tryout  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [21:16:16] <N_tonio36>	 well, it still didn't work  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [21:16:26] <N_tonio36>	 let me print out a new response  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [21:17:25] <N_tonio36>	 ugh, the content-type is being overriden  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [21:18:06] <N_tonio36>	 https://dpaste.de/BEAb  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [21:19:22] <Vulpix>	 :(  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [21:20:09] <N_tonio36>	 well, i guess i gotta reaaally get dirty and dig into the request module  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [21:21:14] <N_tonio36>	 at least i'm aware of the problem, that's a bit of progress i believe  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [21:34:51] <N_tonio36>	 oh i got an idea  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [21:35:08] <N_tonio36>	 freeze the request object, denying any change to id :D  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [21:35:10] <N_tonio36>	 it*  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [23:22:01] <elmerg>	 Does anyone here have any experience using the Comments extension?  
mediawiki 2019-02-24 [23:24:15] <elmerg>	 Or ideas about putting a function call onto a page from a template?  
mediawiki 2019-02-25 [03:10:31] <iyakubovich>	 Is it possible to create a custom skin (available to all users of my mediawiki instance) that is just an override of some css attributes of the default skin?  
mediawiki 2019-02-25 [03:10:51] <iyakubovich>	 for example, let's say I want it to be the same as the default skin but with red headers  
mediawiki 2019-02-25 [03:11:13] <iyakubovich>	 do I have to make a full copy, or can I just supply the additional css?  
mediawiki 2019-02-25 [07:00:31] <legoktm>	 well they should look into https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:CSS  
mediawiki 2019-02-25 [07:20:34] <Nemo_bis>	 Last time I checked, that was easy to reach from one of the most prominent pages in our manual, but then it's hard to imagine what paths new people follow.

mediawiki 2019-02-25 [15:24:12] <stevenm>	 hey a while back we had a simple private mediawiki install with about 10 users... later on i exported all the articles (inc. history) and imported them into a brand new installed (empty) mediawiki at a later version - but i only had 9 of those 10 users  
mediawiki 2019-02-25 [15:25:04] <stevenm>	 so whilst my username (if clicked) of 'stevenm' on a pages history brings up a page to let me edit that user's own page  
mediawiki 2019-02-25 [15:26:09] <stevenm>	 the other user which doesn't exist, lets say "boba" - just bring up their past contributions (or rather contributions associated with that username) whilst saying also... User account "Boba" is not registered.  
mediawiki 2019-02-25 [15:26:24] <stevenm>	 I'm completely fine with how this is handled - the user doesn't actually exist, but contributions are kept  
mediawiki 2019-02-25 [15:26:28] <stevenm>	 So my Q is...  
mediawiki 2019-02-25 [15:26:40] <stevenm>	 how can I delete one of our existing 9 users to produce the same effect?  
mediawiki 2019-02-25 [15:37:40] <stevenm>	 sod it mysql/mariadb time  
mediawiki 2019-02-25 [15:37:45] <stevenm>	 i'll make a backup first  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [02:00:03] <niso>	 Hi, im using ?action=purge on some page and getting no change :S only if i make some change (new lines and so on) the change is "updated", nothing on the job queue, what can cause that?  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [08:55:00] <NorthPark1417>	 Hello, I have a request for a template modification  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [09:01:46] <andre__>	 !ask | NorthPark1417   
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [09:01:46] <wm-bot>	 NorthPark1417: Please feel free to ask your question: if anybody who knows the answer is around, they will surely reply. Don't ask for help or for attention before actually asking your question, that's just a waste of time a both yours and everybody else's. :)  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [09:02:15] <andre__>	 If that template is local on some specific wiki, you probably have to contact that specific wiki though  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [09:05:09] <NorthPark1417>	 Hi Andre, please see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:NorthPark1417/sandbox

mediawiki 2019-02-26 [20:30:40] <wikiwat>	 I tried installing the Echo extension to get notifications (third extension I've ever tried). After updating (first time doing that) my wiki won't show up.  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [20:30:49] <wikiwat>	 I've logged the errors on the page.  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [20:31:14] <wikiwat>	 'A database query error has occurred. Did you forget to run your application's database schema updater after upgrading?'  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [20:31:24] <wikiwat>	 But I did update and it said everything was ok  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [20:31:38] <wikiwat>	 What can I try next?  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [20:32:28] <wikiwat>	 When I go to https://my-site.com/mw-config/ it says 'Upgrade complete'  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [20:33:27] <wikiwat>	 Or does anyone know any resources I can look at? I've been trying to look up the problem, but haven't had luck finding something relevant.  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [20:41:10] <Reedy>	 I'm not sure we necessarily support installing extension db changes via the web installer  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [20:42:32] <Reedy>	 !update.php  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [20:42:32] <wm-bot>	 update.php is a script that updates the database tables. You usually need to run it after upgrading MediaWiki or installing certain extensions. For details, see <http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Upgrading#Run_the_update_script>  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [20:45:15] <wikiwat>	 I did that  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [20:45:20] <wikiwat>	 @Reedy  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [20:45:33] <wikiwat>	 I think maybe I have to manually create the tables?  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [20:45:51] <wikiwat>	 Is there a way to report this issue to the people who make Echo?  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [20:47:20] <Reedy>	 The tables should be created when you run update.php  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [20:48:19] <Reedy>	 Do you have the output from update.php when you first ran it after enabling the extension?  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [20:49:13] <wikiwat>	 They weren't created  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [20:49:27] <wikiwat>	 @Reedy: No, I didn't see any output  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [20:49:37] <wikiwat>	 I don't think the tables exist, though.  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [20:49:42] <wikiwat>	 I don't see them in my db  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [20:49:55] <Reedy>	 Let me be clear, https://my-site.com/mw-config/ is not the same as update.php  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [20:49:59] <wikiwat>	 Not that I knew what I was looking for...  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [20:50:17] <Reedy>	 Do you have shell access to the server your wiki is running on?  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [20:50:37] <wikiwat>	 Welp, if it needs the command line, I don't have access to that.  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [20:51:04] <wikiwat>	 The Echo instructions themselves lead to instructions about mw-config, so I guess I assumed that's what I needed to do  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [20:51:25] <Reedy>	 !echo  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [20:51:25] <wm-bot>	 http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Echo_%28Notifications%29

mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:01:33] <wikiwat>	 @Reedy: The 'update script' link: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Echo  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:01:50] <wikiwat>	 Let me know what you find.  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:02:07] <Reedy>	 Ok, that makes sense...  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:02:29] <Reedy>	 When you go to https://my-site.com/mw-config/ do you get to click on anything? Or does it immediatley just say upgrade complete?  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:02:45] <Reedy>	 Cause you should have to give it an upgrade key to continue  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:03:04] <wikiwat>	 @Reedy: I gave it the upgrade key  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:03:18] <wikiwat>	 Now whenever I go to it, it says it's complete.  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:03:30] <Reedy>	 Hard refreh?  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:04:40] <wikiwat>	 @Reedy: The database literally doesn't contain any folders with the name 'echo' in them.  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:04:47] <Reedy>	 folders?  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:04:58] <Reedy>	 MySQL?  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:05:13] <wikiwat>	 phpMyAdmin  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:05:33] <wikiwat>	 I don't really know if that's the answer you're looking for. This is new to me.  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:05:49] <Reedy>	 I don't know what you mean by folders...  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:05:54] <Reedy>	 It's years since I touched pma though  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:06:04] <Reedy>	 Depending on your mysql config, it puts it all in one file... but if you're talking about PMA, you're not talking about that  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:06:26] <wikiwat>	 Oh, sorry, I assumed they were folders but they have a different icon  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:07:10] <wikiwat>	 It's whatever is showing up in the tree menu on the left in phpMyAdmin  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:07:20] <wikiwat>	 I think I finally found a post that's relevant, though  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:07:37] <wikiwat>	 It says to run the script manually somewhere, so I'm going to try doing that.  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:08:03] <wikiwat>	 https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Topic:Suusljncw7adbayh  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:09:09] <Reedy>	 Is there a more specific error  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:09:22] <wikiwat>	 Yeah, it was about a table not existing.  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:09:27] <wikiwat>	 The scripts seem to be working, though.  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:11:05] <wikiwat>	 Well, the error is gone now.  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:11:16] <wikiwat>	 Don't know if the extension will actually work, though.  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:13:04] <wikiwat>	 Hmm, nothing got added to the DB when I referenced a user's name. [[theusername]]  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:14:18] <wikiwat>	 Well damn  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:14:42] <wikiwat>	 No idea what to do

mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:19:46] <wikiwat>	 So, different question - how are page discussions supposed to work? They just look like a regular page you edit. If one person write something, another person can easily accidentally delete it.  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:19:56] <wikiwat>	 Am I doing something incorrectly?  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:22:07] <Reedy>	 Nope, that's pretty much it  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:22:20] <Reedy>	 At least, with the default "discussion" system  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:30:33] <revansx[m]>	 The Flow extension is pretty popular as an upgrade to the default talk pages. However its future is unclear.  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [21:41:52] <wikiwat>	 @Reedy, @revansx[m]: Any other alternatives?  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [22:40:47] <lemoldu>	 Good evening,  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [22:41:12] <lemoldu>	 I am trying to install mediawiki without using the installation form  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [22:42:50] <lemoldu>	 I choose to use my own Localsettings.php (a copy form a localsettings.php created with the installation form) and it does not work :(  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [22:43:11] <Reedy>	 You can't just put a LocalSettings.php in place and have things work  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [22:43:19] <Reedy>	 You still need to create the database etc  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [22:43:41] <lemoldu>	 I have this king of message https://framabin.org/p/?40267ab27561c950#cmTPn5wAYfDmUpShwDis22o9a7GFbbgd87xqVgsfkMo=  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [22:43:57] <Reedy>	 [22:42:41] <Reedy> You still need to create the database etc  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [22:44:06] <lemoldu>	 the database have been created, I checked in phpmyadmin  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [22:44:21] <Reedy>	 The database might've, but you're missing at least one table  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [22:44:42] <Reedy>	 Or your prefix is wrong in comparison of your database and config in your LocalSettings  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [22:46:33] <lemoldu>	 the prefix looks right, it is the same in the database and in localsettings.php  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [22:46:52] <lemoldu>	 I do not know why this table is missing   
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [22:46:59] <Reedy>	 How did you create the database?  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [22:47:15] <Reedy>	 The other option is that the user you're using for db access can't view the table  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [22:49:25] <lemoldu>	 this is how it looks in phpmyadmin https://framapic.org/1aNPZgSOKETu/M2bYLLi1DFlC.png  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [22:50:18] <Reedy>	 That kinda looks like you only have one table  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [22:50:26] <Reedy>	 so of course MW won't run  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [22:54:48] <lemoldu>	 ok, so I have to find a way to generate those table  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [22:55:31] <lemoldu>	 I should maybe use the php script in maintenance/install.php ?  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [22:56:19] <Reedy>	 That would be the recommended way if you can't/won't/don't want to use the web installer  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [22:56:49] <lemoldu>	 thank you very much  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [22:57:07] <lemoldu>	 does this script generate a new Localsettings.php ?  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [22:58:45] <Reedy>	 It can, but it doesn't have to  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [22:59:13] <Reedy>	 actually, it seems it will, regardless  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [22:59:19] <Reedy>	 To the root  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [22:59:48] <lemoldu>	 great :)  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [23:00:28] <tgr>	 Reedy: do you have a sec? I could use a review on https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/mediawiki/extensions/CentralAuth/+/493087 , there are some broken renames in the queue  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [23:00:30] <Reedy>	 If you don't need/want it... Just move yours out of the way, run the installer, then delete the generated one (or move it out of the way), and then put yours back in place  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [23:01:07] <revansx[m]>	 Is it possible to set a user's email address using a maintenance script? If so, which script?  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [23:01:26] <Reedy>	 revansx[m]: resetUserEmail.php  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [23:02:12] <revansx[m]>	 Reedy, You rock .. thank you!  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [23:02:27] <lemoldu>	 the one from the installer will be fin, I am just trying to find a way to install automatically some wikis without an installation form  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [23:02:47] <lemoldu>	 *fine  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [23:03:48] <Reedy>	 Then yeah, install.php is probably what you want  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [23:04:01] <Reedy>	 Which is what we use for some of our CI infrastructure to "install" MW to test again  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [23:05:31] <Reedy>	 tgr: Having a loook  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [23:05:41] <tgr>	 thx  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [23:10:43] <revansx[m]>	 Reedy, my attempt to use the "resetUserEmail.php" results in the error:   
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [23:10:44] <revansx[m]>	 "Could not open input file: resetUserEmail.php"  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [23:11:08] <Reedy>	 Does the file exist in the directory you're running the command? (hint: probably not)  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [23:11:32] <revansx[m]>	 *derp* .. nevermind.. wrong directory  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [23:11:44] <revansx[m]>	 exactly  
mediawiki 2019-02-26 [23:53:12] <lemoldu>	 \o/ it works !  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [00:21:37] <revansx[m]>	 Reedy,  if I use the command:  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [00:21:38] <revansx[m]>	 sudo php resetUserEmail.php --no-reset-password <username> <emailaddress>  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [00:21:39] <revansx[m]>	 do you know if it autoconfirms the new address?  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [01:07:07] <elmerg>	 Evening all. I need some help with MEdiawiki. 1.32.0. I am working on templates and the templates work fine. However, I have to edit/save any pages that are calling the templates, in order for the template to refresh. I can't get them to display with any other refresh methods, most recent version of Chrome.  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [01:32:40] <elmerg>	 Anyone?  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [01:43:17] <Skizzerz>	 elmerg: yes, that is how templates work  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [01:43:41] <Skizzerz>	 or do you mean that you're using a template on a page, and update that template, but the page using it didn't update?  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [01:43:54] <Skizzerz>	 in that case, it's because either the job queue is running too slowly or not running at all  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [01:44:43] <elmerg>	 So.  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [01:44:46] <elmerg>	 I update the template.  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [01:44:56] <elmerg>	 I then go to the page that is using the template.  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [01:45:06] <elmerg>	 I refresh the page to ensure data is pulling properly.  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [01:45:07] <Skizzerz>	 how many pages are using that template?  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [01:45:21] <elmerg>	 The template doesn't update on the page I refresh.  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [01:45:35] <Skizzerz>	 when you edit a template, tasks to update each page using it are added to the job queue. by default, 1 job is run every time a page is loaded  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [01:45:36] <elmerg>	 RIght now just one, for testing purposes. It's going to be on multiple pages once the wiki gets up and going though.  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [01:45:57] <elmerg>	 *nod* So I'm just refreshing too fast then?  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [01:46:22] <Skizzerz>	 however if the job queue is disabled or the run rate turned down, you'll need to update via the runJobs.php maintenance script (for a production wiki, it's best to set that script up in cron and disable the normal job execution on web requests)  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [01:46:44] <Skizzerz>	 if the jobs have been run and you *still* don't see it, there could be a layer of caching in the way that's serving you old pages  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [01:47:06] <Skizzerz>	 so, imo try running the runJobs.php maintenance script manually and see if that fixes anything. If not, then it's the caching thing  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [01:47:06] <elmerg>	 *nod*   
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [01:47:25] <Skizzerz>	 and we can figure out from there exactly what cache is being problematic  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [01:47:26] <elmerg>	 I tried messing with the cache, I got fatal error. Once I recommented the cache thing I uncommented, the page reloaded with the template.  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [01:47:58] <elmerg>	 Let me make another tweak to the template and see how it works.   
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [01:49:58] <elmerg>	 So when I did the manual runjobs.php it updated immediately after when I CTRL+SHIFT+R'd.  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [02:11:22] <elmerg>	 *nod*   
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [02:11:33] <elmerg>	 I'll take a look at setting up a cron or checking on upping the run rate.  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [02:31:01] <elmerg>	 So if I set it to 1, that might be too much?  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [03:59:52] <Betacommand>	 elrazor[m]: I find using cron works best on smaller wikis  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [03:59:59] <Betacommand>	 fail  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [07:32:32] <kreativenik_>	 Is there a way to have a bulleted list inside of an emphasis box?

mediawiki 2019-02-27 [19:30:14] * revansx[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/v1/download/matrix.org/UMkQTrAaWpzkDJBtehvGuPLo >  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [21:46:37] <Skizzerz>	 revansx[m]: yeah, you can define arbitrary things as rights. They won't *do* anything, but nothing is stopping you from doing it  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [21:46:41] <Skizzerz>	 what issues are you running into with that?  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [21:47:05] <Skizzerz>	 if you do that, and visit Special:ListGroupRights, does it not show that 'team1' group has the 'team1' right?  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [21:47:57] <revansx[m]>	 I just submitted: https://github.com/SemanticMediaWiki/SemanticExtraSpecialProperties/issues/110   
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [21:47:59] <Skizzerz>	 if it's not working properly, try adding this to your LocalSettings.php as well: $wgAvailableRights[] = 'team1';  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [21:48:24] <Skizzerz>	 (that registers it in mediawiki that 'team1' is a valid right that can be assigned)  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [21:48:46] <revansx[m]>	 The actual custom rights group is working fine.. SESP is not picking up on the added groups. SESP works fine for built-in MW groups  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [21:48:52] <revansx[m]>	 (ty)  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [21:51:00] <revansx[m]>	 I'm trying to create inline SMW queries of users in various custom groups.   
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [21:51:16] <Skizzerz>	 did you try running the rebuildData.php maintenance script?  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [22:01:29] <revansx[m]>	 no, but i will. I didn't want to do anything like that until I heard from folks here.  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [22:08:44] <revansx[m]>	 ok.. boom.. there it is.. do I only need to do this when I create a new custom group?  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [22:14:14] <Skizzerz>	 not sure  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [22:14:23] <Skizzerz>	 you may need to do it every time you change someone's group membership  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [22:40:00] <revansx[m]>	 that's the thing that I think the extension owners should know about. thanks!  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [23:57:17] <jonnygootz>	 Helo all i just installed the latest version of mediawiki on debian 9 and all is good except i cant get parsoid to work. Can someone help me. Parsoid shows that its running but i dont see it using any ports  
mediawiki 2019-02-27 [23:57:37] <jonnygootz>	 i have it set to port 8142  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [11:07:41] <yesi>	 hi, How to prevent the identified users to be added to "users" default group that have some rights ? Since it is hardcoded, so we can not be removed. But it is still  intesresting to remove this default right. When i listed the existence groups, i do not see this "Users" default group in the list.  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [12:11:47] <yesi>	 Since i can't move the 'user' group, then i remove all its rights. And then i create another group with the need rights.  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [19:19:54] <Johnny_>	 does Mediawiki 1.32 support Visual Editor and Parsoid?   
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [19:23:25] <Skizzerz>	 yep  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [19:23:45] <Skizzerz>	 you need to grab the versions of VE and parsoid that are compatible with 1.32 instead of the latest (master) version  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [19:26:23] <Johnny_>	 Thanks for the response. Do you have a link that shows where to get this. I have been messing with this for a few days and no luck  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [19:28:53] <Johnny_>	 im running parsoid .10 and VE 1.32-21d40c3  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [19:29:39] <Johnny_>	 i updated Nodejs to 6 and now i can get the edit source to work but when i click on edit nothing happens  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [19:31:08] <Johnny_>	 im also running this on a debian 9.8 box   
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [19:32:17] <Skizzerz>	 if you're downloading tarballs, just follow the download links on the Extension:VisualEditor page  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [19:32:24] <Skizzerz>	 if using git, switch to the REL1_32 branch  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [19:33:25] <Skizzerz>	 your nodejs version may still be too old, or you may be using a too new version of parsoid, or possibly other issues  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [19:33:34] <Skizzerz>	 you'll need to look at error logs for more details  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [19:37:44] <wikiwat>	 I'm trying to edit the sidebar by going to ...MediaWiki:Sidebar, but my sidebar isn't changing when I change things and save. Anyone know any resources?  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [19:42:10] <Skizzerz>	 wikiwat: probably caching at some level. Try clearing your browser cache and bouncing your webserver  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [19:42:28] <Skizzerz>	 (latter is complete overkill but it's an easy way to clear server-level caches)  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [19:46:26] <wikiwat>	 @Skizzerz: I've done cmd+shift+R, but that doesn't fix it. I don't know how to bounce anything...  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [19:47:39] <Skizzerz>	 sorry, by "bounce" I mean "restart the service"  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [19:51:31] <wikiwat>	 @Skizzerz: I don't even know how to do that. Not sure I can if I don't have root access (shared server)  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [19:55:49] <Skizzerz>	 ah, you likely do not  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [19:59:20] <wikiwat>	 @Skizzerz: Any other ideas?  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [19:59:47] <Skizzerz>	 do you have a link to your wiki?  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [20:01:33] <wikiwat>	 Sure, but just a sec. Maybe I'm formatting this wrong. I don't even understand how the current stuff is formatted because it doesn't look the same as for regular pages.  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [20:01:44] <wikiwat>	 Where is the sidebar getting these values?  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [20:02:23] <wikiwat>	 One item that's already working from before says `helppage|help-mediawiki`, but appears as 'Help about MediaWiki'  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [20:02:58] <wikiwat>	 Are these values defined somewhere in another file?  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [20:03:21] <Skizzerz>	 they're interface messages  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [20:03:34] <Skizzerz>	 https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Interface/Sidebar has more details  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [20:03:45] <wikiwat>	 Welp, never mind... things seem to be showing up now...  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [20:03:54] <wikiwat>	 Just took some time?  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [20:04:05] <wikiwat>	 Still won't show the search bar I put in there, though.  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [20:05:34] <wikiwat>	 In that example, how does it know what 'portal-url' is?  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [20:06:27] <wikiwat>	 Hmm, trying to find stuff about interface messages  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [20:07:33] <wikiwat>	 Ok, found Special:AllMessages  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [20:08:31] <wikiwat>	 @Skizzerz: Since that problem's solved, is there a way to make a live group chat for the wiki?  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [20:09:25] <Skizzerz>	 you'd need an extension  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [20:09:32] <Skizzerz>	 I don't know if one exists or not  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [20:09:38] <wikiwat>	 Ok  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [20:10:06] <wikiwat>	 @Skizzerz: Do you have time for more questions?  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [20:10:31] <Skizzerz>	 just ask your questions without directing them at anyone in particular. If someone knows the answer, they'll respond  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [20:10:42] <Skizzerz>	 might be me, might not  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [20:10:52] <wikiwat>	 Heh, ok  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [20:11:43] <wikiwat>	 I want to add an input box to my left sidebar that lets people create new pages. It's basically the search bar, but with a different label.  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [20:11:56] <wikiwat>	 I installed the plugin Input Box.  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [20:12:08] <wikiwat>	 I can use it fine on a page, but can't seem to get it to work in the sidebar. Any ideas?  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [20:13:48] <Skizzerz>	 sidebar is very limited for what you can do with it just on-wiki, see my above link  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [20:14:05] <Skizzerz>	 going beyond that requires writing your own PHP extension or using css/js to inject things  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [20:16:44] <wikiwat>	 Ah, ok  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [20:20:47] <Vulpix>	 wikiwat: It's often more useful to have the inputbox on a single page, with text explaining some basic things about editing, what kind of pages are allowed or not, etc. Also having 2 input boxes could confuse people. I'd put a link to that page instead  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [20:21:28] <wikiwat>	 @Vulpix: Ah, got it. Interesting work-around.  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [21:01:52] <Johnny_>	 I have tried many different combo of nodejs parsoid and no luck. which logs should i look at as the parsoid log not showing any errors  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [22:48:59] <bedah>	 https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Parsoid/Troubleshooting  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [22:50:41] <bedah>	 .oO should look at time before posting a hint  
mediawiki 2019-02-28 [22:51:21] <Skizzerz>	 Johnny_ is still around :)  
mediawiki 2019-03-01 [03:14:27] <iluvalar>	 Hi everyone, thx for being there. There is a bunch of bots creating users on my wiki and creating randomly generated pages. I manage to put the email confirmation edits, but they are still creating users and i would like to revert them. It's a very small wiki with no much edits.  
mediawiki 2019-03-01 [03:21:46] <iluvalar>	 is there a way to delete the 10k pages those bots created ? :'(  
mediawiki 2019-03-01 [03:32:03] <bd808>	 iluvalar: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:DeleteBatch.php might be a fix for you  
mediawiki 2019-03-01 [03:47:36] <iluvalar>	 oh no please... no mysql requests >.< there is really no other way to rever 2 weeks worth of changes ?   
mediawiki 2019-03-01 [05:52:20] <iluvalar>	 i've been attacked by bots, the email confimation test stopped them, but they are still creating tons of user and there is 10k pages created already... can i revert the last 2 weeks ?  
mediawiki 2019-03-01 [06:30:00] <N3X15>	 iluvalar, assuming you have backups, yes  
mediawiki 2019-03-01 [06:30:54] <N3X15>	 You should probably add a captcha like QuestyCaptcha or similar, something that's not easily defeated by OCR  
mediawiki 2019-03-01 [06:31:47] <N3X15>	 Alternatively, add in an approval process for making accounts.  
mediawiki 2019-03-01 [06:53:10] <iluvalar>	 N3x15: I dont have such backups saddly  
mediawiki 2019-03-01 [12:46:16] <chicocvenancio_>	 iluvalar:   
mediawiki 2019-03-01 [12:47:09] <chicocvenancio_>	 iluvalar:  Maybe use a sql query to get all revisions for the last two weeks and revert them?  
mediawiki 2019-03-01 [14:09:05] <finalbeta>	 I want to include some basic mediawiki examples when a user first creates a page through a preload page. Those examples, I would like to place inside another template. can I include the content of a template page as text when a user creates a new page through a preload page?   
mediawiki 2019-03-01 [14:09:13] <finalbeta>	 (I know that sounds complicated :) )  
mediawiki 2019-03-01 [14:10:01] <finalbeta>	 but is there a way I can add something like {{Template:test}} to the preload page and have the content of {{Template:test}} show in the page the user creates.   
mediawiki 2019-03-01 [18:32:38] <tgr>	 finalbeta: yeah, the other option is called editintro  
mediawiki 2019-03-01 [18:32:49] <tgr>	 see https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Parameters_to_index.php#Options_affecting_the_edit_form  
mediawiki 2019-03-01 [20:12:49] <finalbeta>	 thanks for the link tgr

mediawiki 2019-03-02 [13:03:35] <niso>	 Hi, there is a way to get all the subcategories in a category+ count of pages in each one?  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [13:04:25] <niso>	 Something similar to the category page, but to get the sub-categories in list view (With dpl i can get the sub-categories without the pages count)  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [18:33:44] <Sia->	 hi, my mediawiki is in w/ in the website root dir. the links are domain.com/wiki/title  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [18:34:11] <Sia->	 how can keep the mediawiki in the w/ directory not in the root?  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [18:35:45] <andre__>	 Sia-, I don't understand the question.  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [18:36:07] <andre__>	 if your MW is under /w/ then it is not in / but in /w/ already.  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [18:36:21] <Sia->	 right no if you go to my domain.com is directed to domain.com/wiki  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [18:36:44] <Sia->	 i want to use the root for other page and keep the mediawiki in wiki/  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [18:39:18] <andre__>	 Sia-: Change your webserver's config file  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [18:39:45] <Sia->	 andre__ that is with wiki localsettings has nothing to do with webserver  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [18:39:45] <andre__>	 Sia-: Your question seems to be not directly related to MediaWiki then, I think?  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [18:40:13] <andre__>	 Sia-: You don't want domain.com to automatically go to domain.com/whatever, right?  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [18:42:06] <Sia->	 no i want to stop redirection  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [18:42:49] <Sia->	 http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Short_URL  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [18:44:25] <andre__>	 Sia-, http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Short_URL is about redirects inside of MediaWiki.  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [18:44:38] <andre__>	 but you wrote: "i want to use the root for other page and keep the mediawiki in wiki/"  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [18:44:49] <Sia->	 thats my problem i did that as my website was just with wiki  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [18:45:00] <andre__>	 Yeah. Fix your webserver's config file.  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [18:45:14] <Sia->	 now i want to install wordpress in the root and mediawiki should keep staying in wiki/ dir  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [18:46:05] <andre__>	 If you for some reason believe that Manual:Short_URL is relevant here, see https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Short_URL#Guides  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [18:46:39] <Sia->	 that's my config https://pastebin.com/raw/2MKacxQZ  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [18:47:02] <andre__>	 As I wrote before: You don't want domain.com to automatically redirect to domain.com/whatever.  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [18:47:14] <Sia->	 yes  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [18:47:20] <andre__>	 It's irrelevant what "whatever" is. Could be MediaWiki, could be something else.  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [18:47:29] <andre__>	 Hence the problem is not in MediaWiki configuration.  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [18:47:53] <andre__>	 But I'm repeating myself as I've written that twice already...  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [18:48:20] <andre__>	 Where does your Paste  come from?  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [18:48:30] <Sia->	 from .htaccess  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [18:48:31] <andre__>	 that is "your config" of what?  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [18:49:07] <andre__>	 and your webserver software is...?  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [18:49:37] <Sia->	 Apache  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [18:50:07] <andre__>	 so fix it.  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [18:50:18] <andre__>	 Again: I don't see any MediaWiki topic here.  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [18:50:52] <andre__>	 RewriteRule ^/*$ /w/index.php [L,QSA]

mediawiki 2019-03-02 [18:52:35] <Sia->	 oh sorry i remove this line and fixed for yet :-)  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [18:52:38] <Sia->	 Thanks

mediawiki 2019-03-02 [19:00:22] <niso>	 Hi, there is a way to display images from category (category chosen dynamically) in a gallery (without dpl mode=gallery, its ok to query them with dpl)?  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [19:05:08] <niso>	 dpl gallery seems to be more limited than <gallery>, best way i found atm its with cargo (and replace the category selector with db field), but ill prefer stay with categories is there is another way  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [19:11:18] <N3X15>	 Anyone have experience setting up Mathoid to serve multiple wikis on multiple domains?  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [19:11:25] <N3X15>	 Or is that not possible?  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [19:54:36] <N3X15>	 I just want to say it's really frustrating when the documentation for a complex piece of gear is written towards Wikimedia sysops and doesn't give any clue to the rest of us how the heck we're supposed to use it.  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [19:54:47] <N3X15>	 See: Mathoid

mediawiki 2019-03-02 [20:04:51] <N3X15>	 You mean the "self-explanatory" stuff about setting up API endpoints with RESTbase (without explaining whether or not it's even necessary with the CLI setup), and the sample YAML files that contain numerous unexplained references to internal WMF hostnames and whether they can be disabled?  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [20:06:36] <N3X15>	 Not to mention all the parts with unexplained replacements and variables, like `query: '{{ default(request.query, {}) }}'`

mediawiki 2019-03-02 [20:17:35] <N3X15>	 Yeah, my issue is slightly different though, since I'm trying to set up Mathoid to handle math for a farm of wikis.  
mediawiki 2019-03-02 [20:18:08] <N3X15>	 The issue is a lack of configuration documentation, in my case
