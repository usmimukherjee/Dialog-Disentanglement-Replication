ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:21] <rodrigo_> the new gnome-control-center panel? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:21] <diwic> ok, is this gnome 3 control panel? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:22] <rodrigo_> if so, I have master g-c-c running on a dev user, if you want me to look at anything 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:22] <diwic> !startmeeting

ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:23] <diwic> #topic pulseaudio - master or stable-queue 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:23] <diwic> [topic] pulseaudio - master or stable-queue? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:23] <MootBot> New Topic:  pulseaudio - master or stable-queue? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:24] <diwic> [agreed] to go with stable-queue for the time being as the d-bus API in master wasn't all that ronoc wanted, and since a rewrite is planned on master by Lennart. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:24] <MootBot> AGREED received:  to go with stable-queue for the time being as the d-bus API in master wasn't all that ronoc wanted, and since a rewrite is planned on master by Lennart.

ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:27] <diwic> okay, moving on 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:27] <ronoc> am I haven't seen any, only the pa-stream-writable failed

ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:27] <MootBot> New Topic:  anything in particular done in the previous week? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:27] <ronoc> last week, got two sru's out for lucid and maverick 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:27] <diwic> ronoc, for indicator-sound? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:27] <ronoc> and merged my UI natty work into trunk 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:27] <rodrigo_> not much from me, was working on other desktop-related stuff 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:27] <ronoc> yep 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:27] <diwic> ok 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:28] <diwic> For my own part, I was at plumber's 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:28] <ronoc> today i'm working on a fading mute behaviour 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:28] <ronoc> how was it ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:28] <rodrigo_> we have some bugs though about porting indicator-* stuff to gsettings, gtk3 and gtkbuilder 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:28] <ronoc> I must read your report 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:28] <rodrigo_> https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bugs?field.tag=gnome3-gtk3 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:28] <rodrigo_> https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bugs?field.tag=gnome3-gtkbuilder 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:28] <diwic> I learned how to use the wakeup_rt tracer which can be important for tracking down xrun 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:28] <rodrigo_> https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bugs?field.tag=gnome3-gsettings 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:29] <rodrigo_> these will be fixed as soon as the new stack gets in (it's in a PPA for now) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:29] <ronoc> diwic, whats that 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:29] <ronoc> rodrigo_, cool 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:30] <diwic> ronoc, basically, if a kernel driver is blocking pulseaudio from being scheduled, it can help to show the troublesome areas 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:30] <diwic> (or jack, for that matter) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:30] <ronoc> diwic, good to know 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:31] <diwic> ronoc, what's fading mute behaviour? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:33] <ronoc> diwic, when someone chooses mute from the menu, it should fade exponentially the volume and slider to 0, unmuting should restore the slider to its original position 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:33] <ronoc> diwic, a bug against indicator-sound for unity 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:33] <rodrigo_> oh, that's cool 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:33] <ronoc> yup should be pretty easy 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:34] <diwic> cool, for absolute coolness you should also lower the sound frequency, but I guess that's much harder :-) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:34] <diwic> the question is whether that should be in PulseAudio or indicator-sound, really 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:35] <ronoc> diwic, true 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:35] <diwic> you're probably going to have to rewrite that once Lennart gets the volume envelope architecture working 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:35] <rodrigo_> I guess PA, so that when you mute from other parts, it works the same 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:35] <ronoc> diwic, whats the volume envelope architecture ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:35] <ronoc> change 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:36] <diwic> ronoc, some kind of way to apply a volume envelope to a sound 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:37] <diwic> are you familiar with volume envelopes, e g ADSR envelopes? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:37] <ronoc> diwic, yes 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:37] <ronoc> diwic, so that should cover what I'm currently doing 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:37] <ronoc> but its not a biggie 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:38] <diwic> so he merged something from Intel into master but then realized it was broken, so he wants to rip it out, which is part of the major rewrite planned for master 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:38] <ronoc> and as you mentioned earlier no date has been set for when his work is to land 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:39] <diwic> so as long as you're prepare to rewrite it in a year or two 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:39] <ronoc> diwic, sure 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:39] <ronoc> the nature of the ever revolving beast ... 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:40] <ronoc> evolving even 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:41] <diwic> [topic] anything you plan to do in the coming week? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:41] <MootBot> New Topic:  anything you plan to do in the coming week? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:41] <rodrigo_> for me, when the GTK3 stack lands in natty, probably start fixing the indicator-* bugs 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:41] <ronoc> when is that rodrigo_ ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:42] <rodrigo_> ronoc, should be soon, seb128 is going to do it soon 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:42] <ronoc> remove dbus-glib bindings and use gdbus 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:42] <ronoc> rodrigo_, grand 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:42] <ronoc> hopefully this week 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:42] <ronoc> and plan other indicator work 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:42] <rodrigo_> well, dbus-glib is ok to be used, it's not on the deprecation list, but yes, it's a good idea to move to gdbus asap 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:43] <ronoc> rodrigo_, yeah I think the plan is for all indicators, libindicate dependent stuff to be moved over for alpha 1 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:43] <rodrigo_> ok 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:43] <ronoc> i go on holidays on the 22 so need to do in the next two weeks ! 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:44] <ronoc> more than likely starting today 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:44] <diwic> for myself, I want to process some backlog from the weeks I were at UDS and Plumber's, then try to get started on the apport troubleshooting stuff 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:45] <rodrigo_> hey guys, I need to leave now for lunch, are we done? or should I read the backlog later? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:45] <diwic> I think we're done 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:45] <ronoc> all good 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:45] <rodrigo_> ok, I'll read the backlog later just in case :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:45] <rodrigo_> bbl 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [13:45] <diwic> cool, see you!

ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:05] <jjohansen> \o 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:05] <mdeslaur> whoops...forgot you jjohansen  :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:05] <jjohansen> sure, I believe you "forgot" me :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:05] <mdeslaur> hehe 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:06] <sbeattie> heh 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:07] <kees> \o 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:08] <kees> mdeslaur: you start? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:10] <jdstrand> o/ 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:10] <mdeslaur> sure! 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:10] <mdeslaur> so, this week I'm on community, and am working on the long list of mysql CVEs 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:10] <mdeslaur> that should keep me busy 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:10] <mdeslaur> that's it! 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:10] <mdeslaur> jdstrand: your turn 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:11] <jdstrand> I plan to test and push out chromium-browser today 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:11] <jdstrand> there are 2 other updates I am looking at and may snag 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:11] <jdstrand> I hope to get to my natty merges 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:12] <mdeslaur> you nasty merges? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:12] <mdeslaur> :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:12] <jdstrand> there is a libvirt regression for lucid (well it affects maverick and natty too, but the security update didn't introduce it) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:13] <jdstrand> I need to upload that to lucid-- upstream and I are still discussing it 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:13] <jdstrand> and finally, I need to dive into the dbus/apparmor stuff 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:13] <jdstrand> jjohansen: I've gotten your emails but don't have anything intelligent to say yet 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:13] <jjohansen> jdstrand: np 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:13] <jdstrand> that's it from me 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:13] <jjohansen> its just an initial pass from me 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:14] <kees> I'll go? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:14] <jjohansen> I'm sure I'll spew out more as I work on the interface 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:14] <kees> I'm going to be trying to drum up support for upstream kernel hardening this week. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:14] <kees> there's some discussions started on oss-security and lkml so far. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:14] <kees> dan's sent some patches, etc 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:15] <kees> I got the initial pass at apparmor repackaging done and haven't seen anything horrible yet 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:15] <jjohansen> \o/ 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:15] <kees> now we can move forward more sanely on things like moving the cache directory, etc 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:15] <kees> adding bindings 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:16] <kees> I've upgraded to natty now as well, and am finding little glitches 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:16] <jdstrand> kees: apparmor glitches? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:16] <jjohansen> what kind of glitches? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:16] <kees> I did a few merges last week, will continue with a few more this week 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:16] <kees> jdstrand: no, natty glitches. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:16] <jjohansen> ah, yes it is really buggy atm 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:16] <jdstrand> I've heard the natty kernel is less than ideal atm 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:16] <kees> jdstrand: like, gnome-open suddenly stopped using the correct browser 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:16] <kees> yeah, the natty kernel is unusable for me 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:17] <kees> network storms using NFS, missing locking, wheee 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:17] <kees> I'm on the maverick kernel with natty userspace 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:17] <jdstrand> kees: see, you just need to stop using NFS and then the devel release will always work for you :P 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:17] <kees> and I've got a few _large_ php audits I need to do 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:17] <kees> jdstrand: yeah :( 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:17] <kees> that's it from me, sbeattie, your turn 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:17]  * jdstrand finds it odd how often NFS gets borked in the dev release 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:18] <sbeattie> I'm on triage this week. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:18] <sbeattie> I'll also finish up reviewing the apparmor parser patches jjohansen sent out 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:19] <jjohansen> thanks 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:19] <sbeattie> and I'm hoping to test the maverick apparmor SRU as well. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:19] <sbeattie> I think that's all from me. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:19] <jdstrand> was it copied yet? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:19] <jjohansen> I'll have some more ugly patches for you this week 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:19] <jdstrand> I should add that I will test the apparmor SRUs whenever they hit lucid and maverick proposed 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:20] <sbeattie> jdstrand: not sure, I hadn't looked, but I was expecting we'd come out of linaro freeze this week. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:20] <jdstrand> I hope so... 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:20] <jdstrand> sbeattie: it doesn't look like it. it is still 10.10.1 which ftbfs on the buildds 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:20] <sbeattie> ah 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:20] <jdstrand> (10.10.2 is in UNAPPROVED atm) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:21] <jdstrand> https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/maverick/+queue?queue_state=1&queue_text=apparmor 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:21] <jdstrand> and a new lucid upload is also in UNAPPROVED: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/lucid/+queue?queue_state=1&queue_text=apparmor 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:22] <jdstrand> well, new as of 4 days ago 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:22] <sbeattie> cool. I'm also planning to test lucid's SRU whenever it gets approved. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:22] <jdstrand> I followed up with pitti, so now we just need to wait on his response to my followup 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:23]  * jdstrand should have really mentioned all the apparmor SRU stuff during his time) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:24]  * jdstrand is done for the second time 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:25] <sbeattie> alright, anyone else have anything for the security team? jjohansen? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:25] <jjohansen> hrmmm, well nothing immediate, I am just going to drop more parser patches this week, and setup an apparmor ppa 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:26] <jjohansen> containing the newer stuff for testing purposes 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:26] <jjohansen> I also expect the interfaces jdstrand needs for dbus to hit this week 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:26] <sbeattie> jjohansen: cool, let me know if I can help with setting up the ppa. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:27] <jjohansen> sbeattie: will do, I haven't looked at userspace yet, I will get the kernel up first 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:28] <jjohansen> I think I'm done unless you want more details of my crazy plans 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:37] <kees> okay, sounds like we're all set. thanks! 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [18:43] <jdstrand> thanks kees :)

ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:12] <stgraber> geser: was that an actual action item that we forgot to put on the agenda or did we choose to do something else instead (I don't really remember the details) ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:12] <geser> stgraber: wasn't that sort of canceled later in the meeting again? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:13] <stgraber> geser: it may have, though if we did, I'm not really sure of where we are regarding Marco's request then 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:13] <persia> From the log, I wasn't sure it was conclusive (although I'd like to see something done about Marco at some point relatively soon) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:13] <geser> persia: +1 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:14] <stgraber> do we still want to get some help from the CC ? and if so, should we still have geser to bring it to the CC ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:15] <geser> looking at the meeting log from last meeting we want to move the discussion about how to move on to the mailing list 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:16] <geser> I remember writing an e-mail about it but didn't see any reaction to it 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:16] <ScottK> What mailing list? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:17] <stgraber> ScottK: developer-membership-board@l.u.c 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:17] <ScottK> stgraber: Thanks. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:18] <stgraber> should we try to revive this discussion on the mailing list with the goal of having an answer for the next DMB meeting ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:18] <persia> Isn't that the just-us list, with devel-permissions@ being the wide-subscription list? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:18] <stgraber> persia: yes, I belive it's 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:18] <geser> yes 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:18] <ScottK> stgraber: This is a private list? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:19] <bdrung> ScottK: yes. subscription needs to be accepted. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:20] <ScottK> Seems to me like business that should be conducted in public. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:21] <bdrung> lifting the ban on Marco means that he can contribute to Ubuntu through a sponsor. right? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:21] <persia> stgraber, Please give me an action to ask the CC for assistance on this.  It's not clear whether the dispute aspects of the MC were inherited by the DMB (in practice, it hasn't mattered until this issue), so that needs sorting, and I think we've been dragging this out long enough we need help. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:21] <geser> ScottK: we are still at the point where we don't know how to move forward :( 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:22] <persia> bdrung, Yes, and only that.  It does not grant him any specific rights to do so. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:22] <stgraber> [action] persia to ask the CC for assistance regarding Marco's request for unban 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:22] <MootBot> ACTION received:  persia to ask the CC for assistance regarding Marco's request for unban 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:22] <ScottK> geser: I would say that's exactly the time to be working in public. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:22] <bdrung> persia: did he had upload rights before he was banned? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:22] <ScottK> bdrung: No. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:23] <ScottK> Allowing him to contribute via a sponsor is the same as removing all restrictions. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:23] <stgraber> anything else that should be discussed now regarding this matter or should we wait for feedback from the CC ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:24] <geser> ScottK: cody-somerville mentioned in the last meeting that he prefers not to draw to much attention with making it too public 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:24] <persia> bdrung, He's an ubuntu member, and not an ubuntu developer (and never was).  He is not allowed to post to Ubuntu Development mailing lists or IRC channels, except as necessary for administration of his restriction. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:24] <ScottK> geser: That doesn't make it appropriate that it be decided in private. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:24] <persia> geser, Dragging it out as long as we have brings much more attention than any public/private concerns. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:25] <geser> I understand it, I just want to repeat some options which caused that we still don't know how to move forward 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:25] <geser> opionions 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:27] <persia> ScottK, I agree the decision must not be private.  I'm unconvinced that a council oughtn't be able to determine how to make a decision (or not make it) in private, presuming they do so in a timely manner, and make the decided means of decision public. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:27] <persia> (although in this case, I think the lack of action by the DMB in determining a method is essentially consensus-through-inaction that it ought be someone else's problem (so call on the CC)) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:28] <ScottK> persia: I think deciding in private how this will be decided would substantially impair the legitimacy of the result in the minds of at least some community members. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:28] <geser> I guess that the best idea (ask the CC) to break the current dead-lock 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:28] <bdrung> i don't see why it's an problem of the DMB. who spoke the ban back then? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:28] <persia> bdrung, The MC. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:28] <ScottK> bdrung: MOTU Council 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:29] <geser> and the MC merged into the DMB 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:29] <cody-somerville> Its important to me that this not be a popularity contest. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:29] <persia> geser, Well, kinda.  Complex that :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:29] <bdrung> if the DMB can speak a ban, it should be able to lift the ban. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:30] <geser> as I see the problem, we (the DMB) want some more support (as requested in the ban) before we lift it, but we aren't sure how the support should look like 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:30] <ScottK> cody-somerville: I agree with that. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:30] <cody-somerville> And it feels like the requirements for Marco to appeal his ban as set by the former MC make that difficult. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:30] <persia> cody-somerville, How do you mean? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:31] <ScottK> geser: I think putting it that way presupposes the ban should be lifted.  I object to that. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:31] <geser> ScottK: so you see no way for him to lift the ban at all? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:32] <ScottK> geser: It's my preference that it not be lifted.  I don't object to considering the question, but the way I read you comment seemed to me to presuppose an answer, not just ask a question. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:33] <cody-somerville> The requirements for Marco's ban to be lifted are as follows: 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:33] <cody-somerville> 1. MOTUs supporting this wish actively. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:34] <cody-somerville> 2. A solid indication of changes in the work style. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:34] <bdrung> i have a concern: how can someone get support from other MOTUs if he/she can't show that he/she has changed? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:34] <cody-somerville> bdrung, bingo. My question too. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:34] <geser> bdrung: congrats, you found the dilema :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:35] <ScottK> I think there are plenty of MOTU active in areas where he's not banned (most of Debian) for them to form an opinion. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:36] <bdrung> as alternative: a "soft" lift with not everything allowed? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:36] <persia> bdrung, Absolutely not.  There's no useful meaning of "soft". 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:36] <bdrung> ok 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:36] <stgraber> ok, we only have 25 minutes left for this meeting and still have two applications to review. For now persia has an action to ask the CC for help, so I suggest we carry this discussion to the next meeting. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:36] <persia> Several MOTU (interacting with him in Debian), have commented on his application. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 === lifeless_ is now known as lifeless 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:36] <geser> bdrung: how would that look like and still be different from any other non-MOTU? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:36] <persia> Our decision ends up being one of the following: 1) it's not our problem, 2) he has met the criteria, 3) he has yet to meet the criteria. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:37]  * persia agrees with stgraber 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:37]  * micahg wonders why the meeting is 1 hr and not 2 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:37] <geser> micahg: because it would be then 3 hours long 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:37] <bdrung> geser: good question. maybe irc access to get in contact with motus?

ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:38] <cody-somerville> maybe we should just lift the ban and see what happens? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:38] <geser> cody-somerville: I'm pretty sure ScottK will object to that idea 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:38] <stgraber> mtaylor: around ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:38] <bdrung> lift the ban for X month and evaluate it then? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:38] <persia> cody-somerville, No. That's outside our role.  We just have to determine whether he met the criteria. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:38] <mtaylor> stgraber: yup 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:38] <persia> Anyway, we're on a new topic 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:39] <stgraber> mtaylor: According to the wiki you apply for PPU rights for haildb and pandora-build 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:39] <mtaylor> stgraber: yes indeed 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:39] <stgraber> though you already seem to have upload rights on pandora-build 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:39] <stgraber> and haildb doesn't seem to be in the archive ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:39] <mtaylor> stgraber: oh really? great on pandora-build ... haildb should have just been synced 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:40] <stgraber> stgraber@castiana:~/data/code/ubuntu-archive-tools$ python edit_acl.py query -p mordred | grep pandora-build 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:40] <stgraber> Archive Upload Rights for mordred: archive 'primary', source package 'pandora-build' 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:40] <mtaylor> excellent. that makes that easier

ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:40] <geser> does someone remember if we vote on this apps the last time? (and this is just to setup the permissions) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:40] <stgraber> geser: based on what I can find on the wiki, he already had PPU rights on a few packages and wants it extended to these two other packages

ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:42] <stgraber> bdrung: he already has, for all of thems except haildb (which is probably in the NEW queue at the moment) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:42] <geser> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/devel-permissions/2010-June/000076.html 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:42] <geser> the results of his last application 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:43] <mtaylor> sorry for the confusion - it's an ammended application - last time haildb wasn't in the archive yet. (and I thought the same for pandora-build, but I'm obviously wrong about that) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:43] <persia> haildb was source-NEWed, but no binaries are yet available. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:43] <bdrung> ? https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/haildb/2.3.1-1 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:44] <geser> mtaylor: have you DM upload rights for haildb in Debian or upload through a sponsor? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:45] <mtaylor> geser: upload through a sponsor 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:45] <mtaylor> been meaning to apply for DM for it 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:45] <stgraber> I see that libhaildb was already part of the previous application and from what I can see is the binary package built from haildb. I guess we didn't vote on this one last time because it didn't exist in the archive and so we wouldn't have been able to set the PPU for it 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:46] <cjwatson> argh, sorry, I had timezone confusion 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:46] <geser> wasn't it more of not enough records on working on this package? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:48] <stgraber> geser: I'd be surprised considering he's the one listed in every single changelog entry in the debian changelog 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:48] <stgraber> geser: http://packages.debian.org/changelogs/pool/main/h/haildb/current/changelog.txt 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:48] <geser> which are all after June when we processed the application 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:49] <cjwatson> haildb sounds like an easy one to add to mtaylor's list to me, considering 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:49] <stgraber> geser: ok, so the package wasn't even in Debian at the time ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:50] <geser> stgraber: no, looks it got NEWed in Debian 5 days ago 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:51] <cjwatson> indeed 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:51] <stgraber> ok, any other question or should we just go ahead and vote to add haildb to mtaylor's PPU list ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:51] <bdrung> go ahead

ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:56] <geser> nothing on the fridge (not even the current DMB meeting) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:56] <persia> micahg, You say you don't like "The ability to easy switch between archive versions and PPA versions of select packages.", but you don't list any thoughts about fixing that.  Are you able to do so here? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:56] <micahg> persia: I was thinking of some type of selector in software center (a plugin that helped with pinning) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:57] <persia> So, is the problem that you can switch, or is the problem that it's not easy? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:57] <bdrung> micahg: is pinning enough? switching means to have a way for downgrading. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:57] <ari-tczew> micahg is building his career by reporting on another folks from IRC rofl 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:58] <micahg> persia: that's it's not easy to switch back and forth 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:58] <bdrung> micahg: are you aware of ppa-purge? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:58] <cjwatson> there's a command-line tool to do it, I think, which suggests that building UI pieces might not be so far off 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:58] <micahg> bdrung: in some cases yes, but not all 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:58] <micahg> bdrung: yes 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:58] <cjwatson> I think ppa-purge is PPA granularity rather than package granularity though 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:59] <micahg> cjwatson: right 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:59] <cjwatson> mvo might have some thoughts on the UI side 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [19:59] <persia> micahg, A package selector UI seems easy enough: how could one address the bit about maintainer scripts not being guaranteed safe for downgrades? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:00] <micahg> persia: well, there would have to be some way for a package to opt-in to this only in cases where it would be safe 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:01] <micahg> possibly a field in d/control? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:01] <persia> Packages in PPAs declaring that they are suitable for safe install/remove?  How can we trust that when we can't necessarily trust PPA uploaders in general? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:01] <bdrung> isn't it better to make packages downgradable? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:02] <persia> bdrung, Heh, sure, but that's *hard*, because of how maintainer scripts work. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:02] <cjwatson> OTOH it's relatively rare for the sorts of changes in PPAs to be downgrade issues anyway 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:02] <persia> True 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:02] <micahg> persia: that's a more general problem and would have to do with the concept of *blessed* PPAs which seems to be less likely as time goes on 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:02] <cjwatson> persia: if you can't trust the PPA then it might have failed when you switched *to* it 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:02] <bdrung> maybe having a fallback if the downgrade doesn't work? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:02] <persia> cjwatson, Ah, that works. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:02] <cjwatson> so worrying about what happens when you switch away sort of seems like stable door and hose 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:02] <cjwatson> horse 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:03]  * persia has no more questions. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:03] <bdrung> micahg: interested in working on the sponsors queue? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:04]  * ScottK wants to be sure to through in a big +1 for micahg (my attention is needed elsewhere ATM) - I've interacted with him quite a bit at UDS and since and am convinced he'd be a great MOTU. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:04] <micahg> bdrung: yes, but my time for the next month is limited 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:04] <stgraber> ready to vote ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:04] <bdrung> yes 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:05] <geser> micahg: why didn't you manage to find enough DMB members a UDS-M to process your application? :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:05] <cjwatson> that was mostly our fault

ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:07] <persia> I'll volunteer.  I've missed it enough times.

ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:07] <stgraber> anything else for this meeting ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:07] <bdrung> can the chair listed on the agenda? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:08] <cjwatson> normally is 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:08]  * micahg is just curious, are the meetings planned to be 1hr now? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:08] <persia> They were always supposed to be so. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:08] <stgraber> bdrung: when we've got one, it usually is 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:08] <cjwatson> 1hr is usual if we can manage it, but it depends ... 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:08] <geser> micahg: they we always 1 hour 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:08] <stgraber> *he 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:09] <geser> were* 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:09] <micahg> geser: ah, ok 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:09] <cjwatson> sometimes they run long if there's need and if there's nothing preventing it 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:09] <geser> micahg: if we finish in 1 hour is a different question :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:10] <bdrung> back to the Marco: can we get comments from all people who are working with Marco? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:10]  * bdrung fails in forming correct sentences. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:12] <stgraber> ok, I guess we're done for what had to be discussed in this meeting 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:12] <stgraber> #endmeeting 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:12] <MootBot> Meeting finished at 14:12. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:12] <cjwatson> re Marco, I think the action to work with the CC is the next step there - we can ask them to help with that 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:13] <bdrung> ok 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:14] <cjwatson> and, since I wasn't here at the start, welcome bdrung :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:14] <stgraber> bdrung: I'd also suggest you read through the previous meeting logs as it feels like things we already discussed in the past. For now, I think it's best to wait for the CC and re-discuss in another meeting. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:14] <geser> bdrung: the aren't probably many as he is banned from working on Ubuntu dev, you would need to find those who are also active in Debian and see his work there 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:15]  * cjwatson goes back to trying to convince a toddler to GO TO BED 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:15] <bdrung> thanks cjwatson 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:15] <ari-tczew> I'm not up-to-dated... who win - Laney or bdrung ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:15] <cjwatson> bdrung 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:15] <ari-tczew> love it! 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:15] <ari-tczew> (that was not ironic)

ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:15] <ari-tczew> what is the number of all votes? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:16] <cjwatson> low turnout, not that I'm one to talk since I forgot to vote :( 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:16] <geser> ari-tczew: see my mail with the results to ubuntu-devel-announce 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:16] <bdrung> the participation was very low (~ 50 votes) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:16] <geser> cjwatson: I wanted to mail a reminder after UDS but forgot it myself :( (to mail the reminder) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:17] <geser> IIRC 55 votes of 153 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:21] <bdrung> stgraber: in which meetings was marco a topic? 2010-09-27 and others? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:21] <geser> bdrung: the last 2-3 meetings 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:31] <bdrung> geser: do we have a link list to all previous meeting logs? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:37] <geser> no, perhaps I should do one like we had for MC 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-08 [20:37] <bdrung> geser: finding the old logs is hard. especially if the schedule is changed

ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [12:59] <rsalveti> NCommander: and the meeting date is wrong 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [12:59] <ogra_ac> that too 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [12:59] <rsalveti> you created it as 1009 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [12:59] <rsalveti> unless you think the release is tomorrow, you're wrong 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [12:59] <NCommander> ugh 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [12:59] <rsalveti> :-) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [12:59] <ogra_ac> hehe 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:00] <NCommander> davidm: I'm here :-P, no need to call :-P 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:00] <davidm> Yep, just saw that, had phone to ear 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:00] <NCommander> I'm just waiting for GrueMaster to rise

ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:02] <NCommander> There are no action items or special items from the last meeting 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:02] <ogra_ac> when was that anyway 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:02] <NCommander> ogra_ac: the 2nd, but only davidm and GrueMaster was there 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:02] <davidm> Last week 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:02] <NCommander> most of us were in transit for something 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:03] <davidm> I ran it since no one besides Gruemaster showed up 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:03] <davidm> And I like fast meetings

ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:04] <NCommander> All my specs expect spice seeds have their work items in properly. We don't have any notes for spice ATM (waiting for IS to post the audio logs of UDS to recreate them) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:05] <NCommander> once those are done, I'll write that spec, and get the work items up 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:05] <rsalveti> I'm finishing reviewing and finalizing the specs today 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:05] <NCommander> Ugh 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:05] <NCommander> argh 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:06] <NCommander> It looks like since my specs didn't make it to approved, they weren't counted togethers the workitem tracker 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:06] <ogra> hey 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:06] <ogra> no hurry 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:06] <ogra> spec deadline is the 18th 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:06] <NCommander> so the trendline is completely screwed up. again. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:06]  * NCommander bangs his head on the desk 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:06] <ogra> also the WI tracker has to be changed a lot 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:06] <rsalveti> but we all want to do some "real" work soon :-) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:06] <ogra> sure, just go ahead 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:07] <NCommander> [action] NCommander to track down why his specs aren't on the tracker and to have that fixed 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:07] <ogra> still though, the tracker points to the wrong team name etc

ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:08] <ogra> its on my TODO for this week 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:08] <NCommander> on, let's move on 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:08] <rsalveti> will also change the ml?

ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:08] <ogra> NCommander, we dont have kernel guys atm 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:08] <rsalveti> it'd be better to have ubuntu-arm instead of mobile, so we avoid questions regarding eeepc :-) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:08] <ogra> pointless topic 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:08] <rsalveti> until they start shipping arm cpus 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:09] <ogra> hehe 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:09] <lag> cooloney is still with you 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:09] <NCommander> k 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:09] <ogra> rsalveti, well, as i said, up to davidm 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:09] <rsalveti> sure :-) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:09] <NCommander> GrueMaster: any point to doing QA status? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:09] <ogra> lag, true, but not around atm 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:09]  * NCommander guesses not 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:09] <lag> Nope, I believe he's in Lex 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:09] <rsalveti> cooloney did some work this week

ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:09] <GrueMaster> No QA status at this time. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:10] <ogra> for anything else the topics dont suit well 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:10] <ogra> oh, and probably discuss A1 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:10] <NCommander> I currently have improved ARM subarch support + userland subarch support, and spice seeds once we get the session notes recovered and the spec writen.

ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:13] <rsalveti> we'll all end up having work items in different blueprints :-) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:14] <ogra> yep 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:14] <ogra> motre than last time 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:14] <ogra> which is good :)

ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:14] <rsalveti> yup :-) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:14] <ogra> is persia with us ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:14] <davidm> ogra, I have pretty much taken over panda-ppa-build-cluster.   But any assistance with wiki spec gladly accepted ;-P 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:14] <ogra> davidm, i'll do it :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:15] <davidm> rsalveti, I added the paste notes to the botton 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:15] <rsalveti> davidm: cool, was going to do that, but didn't know if I should put at the wiki or the blueprint itself 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:15] <rsalveti> thanks anyway 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:16] <davidm> I put it at the bottom of the wiki for now 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:16] <davidm> Seemed to be a good place 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:16] <davidm> persia, ?? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:16] <NCommander> -ENOPERSIA 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:16] <ogra> rsalveti, the blueprint should just have WIs 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:16] <ogra> all the rest goes into the wiki 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:16] <rsalveti> ok, because I saw many blueprints with notes in it 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:16] <rsalveti> mostly linaro ones 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:17] <ogra> well, for dumping the notes the whiteboard is an easy place 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:17] <ogra> but during cleanup and drafting it should be moved in the proper place 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:17] <rsalveti> ok 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:18] <ogra> also note that linaro might just handle it differently 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:18] <rsalveti> yeah 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:18] <ogra> better to look at ubuntu specs ;) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:18] <nigelb> !info python-gtk2

ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:18] <nigelb> err, sorry 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:18] <NCommander> anyone else got any other specs to post? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:19] <ogra> apart from persias we should have all 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:19]  * NCommander has a pretty good idea at this point who's doing what for the forseable future 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:19] <NCommander> then I'm moving on unless someone else has something 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:19] <ogra> we will get a new employee soon 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:19] <ogra> please think about WIs he can take 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:19]  * NCommander has nothing for FTBFS status, and there are no images yet so ... 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:19] <ogra> from your specs 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:19] <rsalveti> what he's good at? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:19] <ogra> images failed today, havent checked why 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:19] <NCommander> ogra: oh, crontabs are running? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:20] <GrueMaster> Do we still want omap & dove images to build? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:20] <ogra> rsalveti, everything but dont overload him ;) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:20]  * NCommander didn't see a build failure image this morning 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:20] <ogra> GrueMaster, omap -> yes, dove -> no i guess 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:20] <rsalveti> ogra: :-) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:20] <ogra> NCommander, you should have mail 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:20] <NCommander> GrueMaster: Dove is dead. omap3 is in the hands in Ubuntu ARM, and omap4 is maintained by Canonical 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:20] <ogra> davidm, can you confirm ? no more dove in natty, right ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:21] <davidm> correct no more dove in natty 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:21] <GrueMaster> We'll probably kickstart it again mid February-March. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:21] <ogra> for reference: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2010-November/031952.html 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:22] <ogra> that applies to omap3 currently 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:22] <NCommander> GrueMaster: don't make me come and stab you 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:22] <ogra> waiting for solutions from kernel and linaro teams 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:22] <davidm> GrueMaster, I doubt it, the kernel we have access to is too far behind for natty 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:23] <ogra> we might have a slight prob for A1 btw, we need livecd-rootfs to work for the preinstalled ones and i think cjwatson wont focus on live images (usually he looks only at alternate for A1) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:23] <NCommander> ogra: I'll keep on eye on it for A1 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:23] <ogra> so that might need some heavy lifting on our side 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:24] <NCommander> [action] NCommander to supervise pre-installed omap4 images for Alpha 1 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:24] <ogra> to have the deps and seeds right 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:24] <MootBot> ACTION received:  NCommander to supervise pre-installed omap4 images for Alpha 1 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:24] <NCommander> ^- standing item until Alpha 1 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:24] <ogra> as well as ftbfs 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:24] <ogra> NCommander, thanks 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:24] <ogra> the ftbfs list looks awful atm 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:24] <NCommander> ogra: I've got access to GrueMaster's pandas, so I can do TI work again. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:24] <ogra> though thats mainly kde/QT related 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:24] <NCommander> ogra: not as bad as in cycles past TBH 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:25] <ogra> well, but again qreal issues as far as i can see 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:25] <ogra> the always reoccuring issue 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:25] <ogra> NCommander, how about finally applying the upstream fix to it ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:25] <NCommander> ogra: the one we can't fix without breaking the ABI of Qt :-/ 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:25] <Riddell> where are qreal issues? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:25] <ogra> davidm, ^^^ 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:25] <NCommander> ogra: upstream won't move until Qt5 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:26] <ogra> any words on that ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:26] <ogra> Riddell, armel as usual 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:26] <ogra> Riddell, we have that every release 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:26] <davidm> NCommander, I thought upstream wnated the change?? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:26] <NCommander> ogra: sometime in the future. Not even Nokia knows when based off feedback from last Akademy 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:26] <NCommander> davidm: yeah, but they can't until they break the ABI in general 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:26] <ogra> well, they asked for it at the brussels UDS 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:26] <NCommander> ogra: Linaro asked for it 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:26] <ogra> and its really a non issue since its armel only 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:26] <davidm> NCommander, can you please verify that upstream does not want it now? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:26] <ogra> NCommander, no 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:27] <ogra> NCommander, i was at the discussion between asac and upstream 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:27] <davidm> It is really creating havoc here 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:27] <Riddell> ogra: I haven't seen any new qreal issues.  there's the issue with CXXFLAGS += -Wa,-mimplicit-it=thumb 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:27] <NCommander> davidm: we can not break it down here independently of upstream. If upstream wants it broken, they need to fix it upstream, then we get it via normal updates 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:27] <ogra> Riddell, hmm, that might be a new one, usually NCommander puts in a few weeks to adjust his armel patches per app though 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:28] <ogra> which costs a lot of time 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:28] <NCommander> ogra: that's a toolchian issue because we had a patch in previously to make that the default 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:28] <ogra> and upstream aksed to just switch TQ on armel for fixing that upstream 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:28] <NCommander> ogra: doko kicked it out since upstream rejected it. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:28]  * NCommander had a discussion with doko on this very issue during UDS. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:28] <davidm> NCommander, can you please verify with upstream if they want/will take the change. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:28] <ogra> NCommander, on the upstream QT qreal changes ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:29]  * ogra wonders how thats related to doko 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:29] <Riddell> the CXXFLAGS is related to doko 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:29] <ogra> right, but thats fixed 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:29] <NCommander> ogra: CXXFLAGS was doko, and no it wasn't, it was worked around. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:30]  * ogra doesnt really care about stuff that has a fix/workaround already  
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:30] <Riddell> most packages still fail to build on arm because of the CXXFLAGS issue, been waiting for doko to show up to discuss it 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:30] <ogra> what i care about is NCommander  wasting workdays on the same issue each release 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:30] <ogra> adjusting the same patches every round 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:31] <ogra> while upstream asked us to fix it with an upstream patch 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:31] <NCommander> ogra: and we can't fix it upstream 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:31] <ogra> we can 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:31] <NCommander> I'm not repeating this disucssion. We do it every cycle 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:31] <ogra> just patch QT properly and be done 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:31] <NCommander> ogra: how do you suggest we sanely break Qt's ABI 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:32] <NCommander> I'm not doing it 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:32] <ogra> we only break it on armel 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:32] <ogra> and given that we rebuild the whole distro, thats a non issue 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:33] <NCommander> I am *NOT* having this discussion again 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:33] <NCommander> I will post the links to every meeting we have discusssed it 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:33] <NCommander> Because its the same argument going around 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:33] <NCommander> And I have no interest wasting meeting time discussing it again when nothing has changed 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:34]  * ogra prefers wasting 1h meeting time to two manweeks of work  
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [13:35] <ogra> i still fail to see the reason to not do it

ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:10] <sconklin> During UDS, discussions were held which resulted in the adoption of a new process for release of stable kernel updates. Details about why this was needed and how it will be implemented have been committed to the Ubuntu wiki here: 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:10] <sconklin> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/StableReleaseCadence 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:10] <sconklin> It looks like the first official cycle may start on Nov 18th, but this is still indiscussion 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:10] <sconklin> .. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:10] <tgardner> sconklin, any progress on the testing front? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:10] <sconklin> No 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:11] <tgardner> how can we start a cycle without a prototype of the process? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:11] <bjf> maybe we should invite someone from testing to this meeting? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:11] <apw> skaet, any update on the testing ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:11] <sconklin> tgardner: good question. We're awaiting our first information from the people responsible for testing 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:11] <tgardner> hmm 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:12] <apw> bjf, i think we need an action on steve to get one of them here for the next meeting till its resolved 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:12] <ogasawara> I'd sent email yesterday poking hw cert about the testing.  They're still trying to run a full smoke test of the kernel in -proposed to see how long it takes. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:12]  * cking wonders why he pulled the finger out on saturday to do some testing when we are blocked en-route by process

ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:13] <tgardner> .. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:13] <sconklin> we're going to slip the Thursday requirement for verification testing 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:13] <apw> why so ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:14] <bjf> apw, without the full process in place should we go ahead and revert patches? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:14] <apw> (i suspect this is a #u-k discussion) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:14] <sconklin> Because we have not officially begun the new cycle, and have no definition of the testing process. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:14] <apw> lets take this offline then .. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:14] <sconklin> .. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:14] <tgardner> sconklin, well, you have announced that we're gonna do it on a certain date. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:15] <sconklin> tgardner: that's correct, an I can just as easily announce that we're slipping 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:15] <bjf> apw, i thought thats what this meeting was about / for (this kind of discussion) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:15] <apw> oh ok, then i think if you start by slipping the verification revert 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:15] <apw> then people will think they can always assume you will 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:15] <apw> sets a bad precident 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:15] <sconklin> That announcement was predicated on the assurance that we would have testing results by the end of last week 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:15] <skaet> apw, sconklin - haven't got an update - but not sure I'm on the official list to get one. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:15] <apw> the longer we soak with only the patches we are going to release with the more 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:16] <apw> happy [sic] the SRU team will be 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:16] <bjf> skaet, if your not on the "official" list who would be? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:16] <tgardner> sconklin, I think we should go ahead and prototype that part of the process at least, despite not being able to get official testing. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:16] <sconklin> I also have no problem dropping patches as announced, but we are feeling the process out 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:16] <apw> sconklin, testing is meant to occur in the second week after the reversions, right?  so testing will occur after this thursday for the official release 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:16] <skaet> bjf, sconklin is who victorp is communicating with. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:16] <cking> only the patches that are not tested? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:17] <apw> cking, right the un 'verified' bugs 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:17] <cking> cool 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:17] <sconklin> ok, so as announced, we wi can drop all unverified patches on Friday, and then we're in a straight-up testing hold. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:17] <tgardner> sconklin, ack 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:17] <sconklin> works for me 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:17] <cking> and if testing fails to occur, we are effectively roadblocked? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:17] <apw> cking, we are in a bad place. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:17] <bjf> so no changes can be made to the repos until we've reverted patches? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:18] <tgardner> cking, we're no worse off then we were before, e.g., crowd sourcing 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:18] <sconklin> bjf: effectively, yes. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:18] <smb> bjf, That probably is done on a side branch 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:18] <bjf> smb, what good does it do to do them on a side branch? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:18] <sconklin> agreed, we just need to choose a naming convention for the "next" branch 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:18] <sconklin> and we will have a merge window for it 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:19] <smb> I was thinking along starting a branch from the upload and revert 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:19] <smb> then that can be merged back to master 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:19] <sconklin> no reverts, we will remove the patches and force-update the master branch 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:19] <skaet> how about sru-candidate? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:19] <smb> sconklin, I would not do that, but its your decision 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:20] <apw> skaet, in that week we are essentially on hold waiting on verification 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:20] <sconklin> Too much clutter, and I'm afraid it will break all the tools which parse changelogs 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:20] <bjf> sconklin, if we revert, we can comment why it was reverted (failure to verify) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:20] <sconklin> bjf: that will be documented in the bug 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:21] <bjf> also, if we are adding patches to a "next" branch, do we do a "pre-proposed" from that? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:21] <skaet> apw, yah - and from yesterday's probing, it doesn't seem clear on the verification side the handoff between the cert and QA for running tests. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:21] <sconklin> can anyone tell me how many tools there are which parse kernel changlelogs, in and out of the kernel team? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:21] <apw> what about the debian changelog 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:21] <apw> won't that show the patches going in only if you do not revert, even though they are not in the tree ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:21] <smb> sconklin, I just fear that you are causing pain by force-updating and rewriting a sort of pushed tree 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:22] <sconklin> we regenerate the changelog. We simply make the patches dissappear. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:22] <apw> sconklin, i am not sure the archive admins will accept that, as it does not reflect correct history 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:22] <smb> apw, I think at the moment it might be a case where apply and revert are done in two uploads 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:22] <sconklin> The basic assumption I'm operating under is that anything after a tag is mutable 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:22] <smb> apw, That is probably not handled as you would expect in the changelog 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:22] <apw> right, which this is by definition 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:23] <smb> sconklin, But you would do that if you remove patches from before 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:23] <smb> wheras revert does not change the past 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:23] <sconklin> smb: do what? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:23] <bjf> correct, the patches you are "disappearing" have been "tagged" 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:23] <smb> sconklin, you sounded like using rebase -i to remove patches 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:23] <tgardner> sconklin, lets take this offline. its a process issue thats not really relevant to the overall testing issue 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:23] <bjf> as part of a -proposed upload 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:24] <sconklin> smb: but we have numerous tools which parse the changelog, sch as those used by archive admins, and those tools do not understand reverts as far as I know 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:24] <apw> sconklin, a revert is just another patch on top 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:24] <apw> they do not need to be understood per-see 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:24] <sconklin> I understand that, but it leaves the original patch and the buglink 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:24] <apw> we might wish to drop the bug link ... 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:25] <smb> sconklin, apw Lets discuss this later on 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:25] <apw> ack 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:25] <apw> .. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:25] <sconklin> yes, we'll tackle this later

ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:26] <apw> Work has started on updating the Ubuntu drivers.  Work centers on updating aufs2 which is a blocker for (performant) live-cds.  Pulled in an experimental version of aufs2 for testing in v2.6.36.  Also pulled this up to v2.6.37-rc1 and did some testing.  Looking good so far.

ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:28] <apw> Natty has just moved over to a v2.6.37-rc1 based kernel.  Stability is unexpectedly high.  Work is ongoing to get aufs2 working again so we can have performant live-cds shortly; likely in the next upload.  Blueprints are mostly up to date with initial work items and work is just beginning on our deliverables. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:28] <apw> Anyone who has not yet added milestones for their work items are likely to find I have assigned them one.  You may well find that means your entire natty workload is now scheduled for natty-alpha-1.  Please review these and split them out as necessary.

ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:33] <apw> .. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:33] <bjf> ogra_ac, go 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:33] <ogra_ac> i would like to rais some attention to 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:33] <ogra_ac> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2010-November/031952.html 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:33] <ogra_ac> which the arm team would like to have clearness about 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:34] <apw> Subject: Ubuntu ARM and the linaro kernels 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:34] <apw> ogra_ac, yes, that is on our radar ... when we know yo 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:34] <ogra_ac> its currently not clear where the kernels for the new images are supposed to come from and who does the maintenance and how 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:34] <apw> you will know too :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:34] <ogra_ac> ah, good 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:34] <tgardner> ogra_ac, its not cleat to us either 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:34] <tgardner> clear* 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:34] <ogra_ac> my main concern is that we need "distro" kernels 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:34] <ogra_ac> thats fine then :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:35] <apw> ogra_ac, yes, and supported ones 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:35] <cooloney> i think we are pretty sure about that, we will keep ti-omap4 branch as Maverick 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:35] <ogra_ac> ++ 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:35] <cooloney> but not sure about the omap3 solution 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:35] <ogra_ac> omap3 is moving to linaro on my request 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:35] <bjf> apw, it may be on the radar but the email thread is getting no love 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:35] <apw> ogra_ac, are you testing a CD with their output (omap3) ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:35] <ogra_ac> with worst case dropping full support for the image if we cant get a distro like kernel for it 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:35] <cooloney> so who are going to maintain that omap3 stuff in our distro kernel 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:36] <ogra_ac> and keep it as a community goodie 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:36] <ogra_ac> apw, thats the plan 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:36] <ogra_ac> my only concern is about security support 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:36] <ogra_ac> but i'm willing to demote the image to a community one 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:36] <apw> bjf, yes that is true, when we have some clarity we will publicise ... 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:36] <ogra_ac> omap3 is just a nice to have 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:37] <apw> ogra_ac, well the result of your testing will help very much with the planning process for this arm stuff 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:37] <ogra_ac> omap4 has to be supported but there seem to be no probs ahead with that 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:37] <apw> ogra_ac, when might we see your test results there.   we probabally need an official work-item for that testing as it is gating on some of the decision making imo 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:37] <ogra_ac> apw, right, prob is that we need the kernel in main etc 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 === pleia2_ is now known as pleia2 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:38] <ogra_ac> and indeed would prefer ubuntu suace as well as similar configs 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:38] <sconklin> we have no resources at all for anything that is simply "nice to have" 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:38] <apw> ogra_ac, it should have sauce in theory ... 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:38] <ogra_ac> neither is clear yet if linaro can do that 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:38] <ogra_ac> all i heard yet was that sauce is ripped out in linaro 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:38] <ogra_ac> i might be wrong though (and would be happy to be) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:38] <apw> bjf could you action me to get some work-items for arm testing created 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:39] <ogra_ac> and that the amount of built drivers is supposed to be reduced in linaro 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:39] <tgardner> ogra_ac, John Rigby sends me pull requests for linux-linaro that has Ubuntu SAUCE

ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:39] <ogra_ac> tgardner, awesome 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:39] <ogra_ac> then i'm wrong (and happy) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:39] <tgardner> ogra_ac, and has been for all of Maverick 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:39] <ogra_ac> ok 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:39] <ogra_ac> i didnt touch any linaro kernels before 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:40] <tgardner> ogra_ac, I think you should try it out. I thought you were already using it 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:40] <bjf> tgardner, do those also have security updates? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:40] <ogra_ac> nope, they dont have all drivers nor the same config 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:40] <ogra_ac> and no security support at all 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:40] <tgardner> bjf, yep cause jrigby rebases against Maverick master 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:40] <bjf> tgardner, cool 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:40] <ogra_ac> (which doesnt help much in natty) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:41] <tgardner> ogra_ac, natty is a different story that is still in development 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:41] <ogra_ac> right 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:41] <ogra_ac> my concern is all about natty 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:41] <ogra_ac> maverick is done 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:41] <ogra_ac> we only do SRUs and maintenance 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:42] <tgardner> ogra_ac, I just don't know what the RM story for natty is yet. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:42] <ogra_ac> (we wont change anything thats not SRU) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:42] <tgardner> ARM* 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:42] <ogra_ac> yes, nobody seems to 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:42] <ogra_ac> yet i have to build images for alpha1 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:42]  * cooloney feels lost 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:42] <tgardner> ogra_ac, you shold be talking to jrigby 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:43] <ogra_ac> tgardner, that wont solve anything on the distro side 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:43] <tgardner> ogra_ac, why not? He's producing a distro kernel. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:43] <ogra_ac> i just noticed i have a mail from him but that wont help with distro or security 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:43] <ogra_ac> he doesnt build all drivers 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:43] <tgardner> ogra_ac, ok, so bug him to turn stuff on or off 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:43] <ogra_ac> we want mostly identical configs across all builds 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:44] <ogra_ac> k 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [17:44] <bjf> does anyone have anything else?

ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [18:12]  * jjohansen is hanging around too 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [18:12] <jjohansen> SpamapS: I think the whole dst ending in n. america may have messed people up a bit 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [18:13] <SpamapS> jjohansen: yeah, plus the time was set at 19:00 in the header by ttx last week because he wasn't going to be able to attent at 18:00 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [18:13] <SpamapS> ok, I'll change the meeting time back to 19:00 in the header, and we'll try again in 45 minutes

ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:02] <SpamapS> Unfortunately, I believe those ACTION points in the agenda are the same as last week's. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:03] <JamesPage> is that because we did not do them last week? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:03] <SpamapS> please standby I will grep them out of the meeting log from last week.. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:04] <SpamapS> Ok there were none it seems

ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:04] <SpamapS> [TOPIC] Natty Development 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:04] <MootBot> New Topic:  Natty Development 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:04] <mathiaz> it's always like that at the begining of a release cycle 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:04] <SpamapS> Indeed. :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:05] <SpamapS> I added this topic, just wanted to make sure people had a forum for any questions or comments on the spec process. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:05] <mathiaz> so the focus is to get WI defined 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:05] <robbiew> right 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:05] <SpamapS> We should all be submitting specs for review by... is it next Thursday? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:05] <mathiaz> once the WI are defined and rough plan is outlined the spec status should be moved to Review 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:05] <robbiew> and I've started reviewing/approving/deferring/asking :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:06]  * robbiew gave https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/NattyBlueprints some loving 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:06] <SpamapS> Feature Definition Freeze is 11/25, so specs must be approved before then right? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:06] <mathiaz> one thing to consider is that it's possible (and actually encouraged) to add WI after the spec has been approved 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:06] <SpamapS> yes, its mostly about getting the design and intent clear 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:06] <mathiaz> as it helps to keep track of what needs to be done 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:07] <SpamapS> And a general idea of how much is needed to be done. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:07] <mathiaz> and if an important is taking more time we can know in advance what other things should be dropped 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:07] <mathiaz> so WIs defined when a spec is approved are not set in stone 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:08] <SpamapS> ok, anything else on Natty? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:08] <mathiaz> Natty is going to ROCK! 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:09] <SpamapS> Its going to burst forth from the ocean like a unicorn with flippers and a blow hole. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:09] <robbiew> lol 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:09] <SpamapS> Alright, moving on. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:09] <RoAkSoAx> is the meeting almost over or just started?

ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:09] <MootBot> New Topic:  Maverick SRUs 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:10] <SpamapS> I think this list also wasn't updated in the agenda.. and zul was mostly in charge of these, but does anyone have new ones to bring up for discussion? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:10] <JamesPage> yes - bug 666028; 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:10] -ubottu- Launchpad bug 666028 in openldap "apt-get install slapd => Can't locate object method "new" via package "Debconf::Element::Noninteractive::Booleam"" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/666028 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:10] <JamesPage> for awareness more than anything else; its a follow up to bug 658227 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:11] -ubottu- Launchpad bug 658227 in openldap (Ubuntu Natty) "upgrade process does not upgrade underlying BDB format from 4.7 to 4.8 (so slapd aborts with "Program version 4.8 doesn't match environment version 4.7" error message)" [High,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/658227 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:11] <mathiaz> JamesPage: the upload has been accepted in maverick-proposed 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:11] <mathiaz> and should be ready in a couple of hours for testing 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:11] <JamesPage> yep  - just went through 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:11] <SpamapS> right looks like pitti accepted it into proposed just now 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:11] <JamesPage> its holding up bug 661547 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:11] -ubottu- Launchpad bug 661547 in openldap (Ubuntu) "Existing patch gssapi.diff makes guess_service_principal produce garbage" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/661547 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:12] <JamesPage> but that might be debatable for SRU (we'll see I guess) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:12] <SpamapS> Is anyone signed up to do the verification yet? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:12] <mathiaz> SpamapS: usually it's the SRU team in QA that does it 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:12] <SpamapS> Ok.. I tend to verify my SRU's too. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:12] <mathiaz> SpamapS: however it's become a zero-man team recently 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:12] <SpamapS> wha? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:13] <mathiaz> well - not really - volunteer are still trying to do verification 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:13] <mathiaz> but it can take time 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:13]  * SpamapS debates an action for robbiew: "FIX IT!" 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:13] <mathiaz> so having someone within the server team taking care of sru-verification would be helpful 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:13]  * robbiew is no longer release manager ;) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:13] <mathiaz> I'll do the sru-verification for openldap 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:14] <robbiew> +1 on having Server team member on SRU team 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:14] <robbiew> we are lucky to have pitti back from oem rotation this cycle for sure \o/...but help is definitely needed 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:14] <mathiaz> it's also better to have the sru verification done by someone else than develop and sponsored the fix

ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:14] <SpamapS> s/better/vital/ 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:15] <mathiaz> which means that 3 people are required for getting an SRU through 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:15] <mathiaz> (1 developer, 1 reviewer, 1 verifier) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:15] <SpamapS> Ok, so maybe another topic for discussion should be that we should raise the SRU manpower issue? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:15]  * hggdh pays attention now 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:15] <mathiaz> yeah - that would be an interesting issue to solve 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:16] <mathiaz> we had plans to improve the SRU process 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:16] <SpamapS> maybe somebody could publicize that we are in need of some volunteer help for SRU's 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:16] <mathiaz> (devised in the summer sprint in dublin more than 1 year ago)

ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:17] <robbiew> SpamapS: heh...if it were just advertising, it'd be a simple process to solve 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:17] <robbiew> MIR team needs help too 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:17] <SpamapS> yeah no kidding :p 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:17] <mathiaz> the SRU tracker was designed as a tool to help in tracking what needs to be done 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:17] <robbiew> and the Release Team could stand to grow a bit.../me gets off his soap box 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:17] <robbiew> :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:17] <mathiaz> it mainly is a ressource issue 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:18] <mathiaz> s3hh: a review task is about reviewing the SRU prepared by another developer 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:18] <mathiaz> s3hh: given that SRU is making there are no regression many eyes are important 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:18] <SpamapS> Ok, so right now, we just make it clear that there is a resource issue, and tax other devs for verification? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:18] <ajmitch> robbiew: I didn't think the release team was necessarily involved in SRUs :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:19] <mathiaz> SpamapS: yeah - I think that's the good way 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:19] <mathiaz> SpamapS: with the sru tracker we should be able to generate a list of bugs that need to be verified 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:19] <robbiew> ajmitch: you should check out the members of each then ;) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:19] <SpamapS> mathiaz: there's a tag for that ;) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:20] <mathiaz> SpamapS: and then the verification needs to be done by someone 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:20] <ajmitch> SpamapS: is the problem mostly verification, or getting a package into -proposed in the first place? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:20] <mathiaz> SpamapS: yes - the SRU tracker also filters the list to make it relevant to server package 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:20] <mathiaz> ajmitch: both ;) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:20] <SpamapS> So maybe we should add a "daily verification" schedule similar to daily triage. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:20] <mathiaz> SpamapS: make it smaller chunks 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:20] <mathiaz> SpamapS: yop - that was the next step :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:21] <SpamapS> zul_: think you could add a list of verification-needed bugs to the SRU tracker easily? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:21] <mathiaz> SpamapS: it already is IIRC 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:21] <SpamapS> yes, why yes it is 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 === bjf[afk] is now known as bjf 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:21] <mathiaz> SpamapS: http://people.canonical.com/~chucks/SRUTracker/sru-tracker-bugs.html#verified_bugs 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:22] <SpamapS> [ACTION] ALL: please check the SRU tracker for verification-needed bugs and help out with verification 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:22] <MootBot> ACTION received:  ALL: please check the SRU tracker for verification-needed bugs and help out with verification 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:22] <SpamapS> Ok, lets move on 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:23] <SpamapS> ajmitch: getting things into proposed seems to happen at a fairly nice pace, we can thank pitti for that. 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:23] <SpamapS> [TOPIC] Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (hggdh) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:23] <MootBot> New Topic:  Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (hggdh) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:23] <hggdh> k 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:23] <hggdh> first question is from myself 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:23] <hggdh> how are we going to test server images for MAC, armel, PPC? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:24] <hggdh> nice to have them, but... 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:24] <ajmitch> SpamapS: oh I meant getting a package ready for -proposed, ie finding the fix 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:24] <mathiaz> hggdh: are there any images published for these architecture? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:24] <hggdh> mathiaz: yes, just popped in in the server/daily 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:25] <JamesPage> whats the status of libvirt/kvm on those architectures? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:25] <SpamapS> hggdh: I believe there were some build machines distributed for armel at UDS.. did we not get QA machines as well? 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:25] <hggdh> SpamapS: none for server testing at least; I did not hear of any for QA at all 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:26] <mathiaz> hggdh: well - I think these images should be tested 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:26] <s3hh> JamesPage: well ppc kvm is supposed to work iirc 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:26] <mathiaz> hggdh: in order to do that hardware needs to be available 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:26] <hggdh> mathiaz: I agree, I  did not say they would not, I asked *how* ;-) 
ubuntu-meeting 2010-11-09 [19:26] <mathiaz> hggdh: which I don't have
