ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [09:56] <ogra> and the universe candidates didnt change much either 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [09:56] <dholbach> wasabi? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [09:56] <Keybuk> dholbach: given the agenda, he's likely to miss the meeting 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [09:56] <dholbach> I'm very sorry that it has to happen. He's a real asset for Universe.

ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [09:58] <Keybuk> sfllaw: add yourself to the list <g> 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [09:59] <mdz> sfllaw: https://launchpad.net/people/ubuntu-core-dev

ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [09:59] <ogra> membership ?  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [09:59] <sfllaw> I didn't even know I was on the Core Development Team until five seconds ago.

ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:00] <sfllaw> Well there we go. 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:01] <mdz> sfllaw: the basic process for gaining upload privileges in Ubuntu is to apply for membership in the appropriate team and turn up at a meeting (like this one) to be considered 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:01] <Keybuk> random thought, why doesn't irc.ubuntu.com point to freenode? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:01] <mdz> sfllaw: typically you bring along an existing member who has worked with you and can speak on your behalf 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:01] <ogra> mdz, couldnt we just make employees automatically members ?  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:01] <ogra> (i think its worth a policy change) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:02] <ogra> i mean signed contract yadda yadda ... 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:02] <mdz> ogra: that strikes me as inappropriate, and if I'm not mistaken, sabdfl has explicitly spoken against it

ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:05] <dholbach> I can try to say some bits: I was in touch with sfllaw around 2 years ago, when I used wvstreams for a project - at that time I was impressed on how fast he reacted, analyzed the problem I had and got the fix either into Debian or fixed it directly upstream. That's what I can say about his Debian / packaging skills. 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:05] <dholbach> sfllaw: for how long have you been a Debian maintainer now? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:06] <mdz> jbailey was just walking onto an airplane, he won't be able to make it 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:06] <ogra> dholbach, thats already 2 years ago ? woah

ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:08] <dholbach> or maybe it was even longer ago 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:08] <sivang> ogra: ah, so we already met each other probably  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:09] <mdz> sfllaw: have you wandered off? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:09] <sfllaw> mdz: Nope. 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:10] <sfllaw> dholbach: I've been looking... 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:10] <dholbach> ah... ok :-) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:10] <mdz> sfllaw: it's probably best if we wait until the next meeting for this, when you have some time to prepare 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:10] <sfllaw> Fair enough. 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:11] <mdz> dholbach: heard from gloubigoula? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:11] <sfllaw> dholbach: January 2000 was when I started. 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:11] <dholbach> mdz: yeah, as I said: he'll be 30m late, so ~20m he should be here 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:11] <mdz> is there any other business? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:11] <dholbach> the only other applicant (that really meant it) was afaik wasabi

ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:11] <mjg59> Daf is around if we want to do his motu? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:12] <wasabi> I was an applicabt? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:12] <wasabi> applicant? I was wondering why you were yelling at me. 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:12] <dholbach> wasabi: for ubuntu-dev? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:12] <wasabi> Already in.

ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:12] <dholbach> wasabi: Oh sorry, I must have missed that. I just rememberd you signed up with the team. 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:12] <wasabi> Yeah, I was "missed" in the LP migration somehow, and was too busy to notice. 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:13] <mdz> wasabi: who took care of that for you? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:13] <wasabi> keybuk 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:13] <ogra> daf sounds like a good start ...

ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:14] <wasabi> Hmm. I think I was in ubuntu-core-dev, too. 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:14] <wasabi> But I haven't had to work on my packages in main in a long while.

ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:15] <Keybuk> wasabi: only found your ubuntu-dev meeting 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:15] <wasabi> k. No biggy. 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:15] <wasabi> I'm done with Java stuff anyways. 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:16] <mdz> wasabi,Keybuk: the archive keyring was authoritative at the time 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:16] <mdz> and that's what I worked from when migrating to LP 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:16] <mdz> daf: welcome 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:17] <mdz> daf: care to tell us a bit about your involvement with ubuntu and plans for future involvement? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 === sivang hugs daf  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:17] <daf> mostly been involved with Rosetta stuff 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:17] <daf> occasional patches 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 === mvo waves to daf 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:18] <daf> my impetus for upload privileges is to be able to upload stuff to Ubuntu at the same time as I upload to Debian 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:18] <mdz> daf: you're a Debian developer as well, yes? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:18] <daf> aye 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:18] <mdz> daf: which packages do you maintain there?

ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:21] <mdz> daf: have you done any Ubuntu uploads through an existing developer? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:21] <daf> no, don't think so 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:21] <dholbach> daf: didn't I uploaded a patch and new gnome-gpg or something? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:21] <dholbach> daf: or you worked on it and I synced it? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:22] <daf> that was a sync 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:22] <dholbach> Ok.

ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:23] <Gloubi|AFK> hi 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:23] <dholbach> then we investigated a bit in the gossip package 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:23] <raphink> tb is @ 22UTC right ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:23] <mdz> raphink: it's at 20UTC as always, and it's in progress right now 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:23] <raphink> ouch sorry mdz :( 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 === raphink keeps quiet 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:23] <daf> dholbach: indeed 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:23] <mdz> dholbach: care to comment on your experience working with daf? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:24] <dholbach> mdz: he was very easy to work with, we discussed some gossip bugs and had a look on a new gnome-gpg version and he was always easy to work with. 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:25] <dholbach> He answered quickly and things were done in no time. I was happy. :-) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:25] <mdz> Keybuk: any questions? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:26] <Keybuk> mdz: no questions

ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:26] <mdz> votes 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:26] <mjg59> +1 on the basis that I can hit him in person if he does anything wrong 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:27] <ogra> heh 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:27] <Keybuk> +1 from me 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:27] <dholbach> hahaha 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:27] <mdz> +1 from me based on Debian experience and dholbach's advocacy 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:27] <mdz> daf: done and done 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:27] <mdz> daf: welcome

ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:27] <raphink> :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:27] <ogra> welcome daf 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:27] <mdz> Gloubiboulga: I believe you're next? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 === Gloubiboulga is Gauvain Pocentek 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:27] <Riddell> daf: well done 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:28] <mjg59> Gloubiboulga: So, what do you want to do in Ubuntu? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:28] <Gloubiboulga> I guess I'm the next one mdke  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:28] <Gloubiboulga> mjg59, my work has been centered on Xubuntu for a month 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 === mdke passes it onto mdz 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:28] <janimo> s/work/great work/ 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:29] <Gloubiboulga> I'd like to keep working on this, even if Xfce is in main now:) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:29] <mdz> janimo: have you been uploading his packages? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:29] <janimo> mdz, yes 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:29] <janimo> all his xfce work 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:29] <mdz> janimo: and reviewing them before upload, presumably. ;-)  what is your assessment of his work? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:30] <janimo> mdz, very nice work. 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:30] <janimo> thorough 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:31] <mdz> Gloubiboulga: presumably you will continue to work through janimo for Xubuntu packages for now; is there any other area where you would like to work as a MOTU? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 === raphink has reviewed Gloubiboulga's work on REVU since he began contributing and is also very happy with the quality of his work 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:31] <Gloubiboulga> mdz, not really a particular aera 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:31] <janimo> mdz, there are still some bits left in ubinverse for xubuntu 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:31] <janimo> he has some new uploads from xfce upstream in the queu 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:31] <janimo> e 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:32] <Gloubiboulga> I'm really interesting in helping new packagers 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:32] <Gloubiboulga> I've comment some packages on REVU, it's an important part of the MOTU work imo 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:32] <Gloubiboulga> *commented 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:32] <ogra> yes, thats true ...  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:33] <raphink> yes, I have advocated comments on REVU for Gloubiboulga as he sent them to me 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:33] <ogra> Gloubiboulga is very helpful to people in -motu 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:33] <raphink> most of good interest 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:33] <raphink> Gloubiboulga: have you gotten in touch with laserjock to help with packaging guide? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:33] <dholbach> Yeah, I personally liked how he steppd up in ubuntu-bugs as well, took care of patches for issues in universe-bugs, etc 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:33] <dholbach> I'm pleased with his work there 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:33] <mdz> ok 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:33] <Gloubiboulga> raphink, nop, I read his guide, discussed a few thing with him, that's it 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:34] <mdz> Keybuk,mjg59: any questions for Gloubiboulga? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:34] <Keybuk> nope, no questions from me 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:35] <mjg59> Gloubiboulga: What are your aims for xfce? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:35] <Gloubiboulga> mjg59, Xfce itself is fine, but Xubuntu can provide a much more usable desktop 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:36] <Gloubiboulga> It's easily installable, comes on an iso 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:36] <Gloubiboulga> everything is done to have a clean, stable distro using this desktop 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:37] <mdz> Gloubiboulga: is there anything in particular that you feel is missing which you would like to work on adding? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:37] <janimo> Gloubiboulga has been in touch with xfce panel plugin writers, about them being in time for dapper 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:37] <Gloubiboulga> mdz, yes, some tools are missing, like keyboard, printer manament 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:37] <lucasvo> imho notebook support in xubuntu is poor 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:37] <Gloubiboulga> managment* 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:38] <Gloubiboulga> lucasvo, true 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:38] <janimo> lucasvo: true. the only thing there is susp/hib form logout menu 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:38] <lucasvo> janimo: exactly 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:38] <lucasvo> no battery status etc. 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:38] <janimo> lucasvo: there's a battrey plugin in main since yesterday 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:38] <mdz> Gloubiboulga: are there good solutions for keyboard and printer functionality which exist but are not in Xubuntu yet? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:38] <Gloubiboulga> mdz, Xfce only cannot satisfy a desktop user imo 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:38] <janimo> was in universe 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:38] <lucasvo> janimo: ah, ok 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:39] <janimo> Gloubiboulga actually works on the xkb plugin now, but for some reason not mentioningit 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:39] <Gloubiboulga> mdz, you can't easily set up different keuboard layouts for exemple 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 === mvo [n=egon@p54A648B2.dip.t-dialin.net]  has joined #ubuntu-meeting 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:40] <Gloubiboulga> mdz, janimo just told it, I'm working on the xkb plugin to solve this 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:41] <Gloubiboulga> editing xorg.conf is not an easy for most users :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:41] <Gloubiboulga> esay thing even 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:41] <mdz> ok 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:41] <mdz> Keybuk,mjg59: votes? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:42] <Keybuk> +1 from me, good to get more xfce work 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:42] <mdz> +1 for Gloubiboulga based on several MOTU recommendations and good work demonstrated with janimo 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:43] <mdz> did we lose mjg59? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:43] <mdz> Gloubiboulga: at any rate you have a majority, congratulations and welcome 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:43] <janimo> Gloubiboulga: congrats :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:43] <dholbach> congratulations Gloubiboulga! welcome to the team! 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:43] <Gloubiboulga> thanks :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:43] <ogra> congrats Gloubiboulga  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:43] <raphink> welcome Gloubiboulga :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:44] <raphink> a fait plaisir de t'avoir comme dev :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:44] <mdz> I believe that's the end of the agenda? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:44] <Gloubiboulga> merci raphink ;) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:44] <ogra> yep 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:44] <Gloubiboulga> janimo, dholbach, ogra thanks a lot :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:44] <dholbach> thanks everybody 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:44] <mdke> mdz, i have a quick question, if you have time. I've written it already so it should be fast. 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:44] <dholbach> Gloubiboulga: anytime - you deserved the praise 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:44] <mdz> mdke: shoot 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:44] <mdke> I've vaguely followed the meeting since I joined the channel, is it correct that ubuntu membership is no longer required for becoming a developer (some of the candidates considered are not members, and some of the core-dev team don't appear to be either)? If so, I think we should update the website: it gives a slightly misleading account of the community governance process. Or alternatively, the ubuntu-members LP group may be incomplete. 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:45] <ogra> mdke, its still required 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:45] <mdke> so the latter? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:45] <mdz> mdke: they're somewhat disconnected at the moment; people generally go through the processes separately 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:45] <mjg59> Whoops, sorry about that 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:45] <mdz> indeed, they're handled by different groups 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:45] <mdke> mdz, does it matter which goes first? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:45] <mjg59> But I agree 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:46] <mdz> mdke: for my part, I don't mind which goes first, but they should happen close together 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:46] <mdz> folks who are in ubuntu-dev but not members should go through the membership process 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:46] <mdke> ok, the website is definitely misleading then 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:47] <raphink> indeed 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:47] <mdz> what we wanted to avoid was folks having to wait 3 weeks or more, and attend adjacent meetings, to go through the process 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:47] <mdz> this is probably something to be discussed at CC next week 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:47] <mdke> ok fine 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:47] <mdz> logically, it would make sense for membership to be a prerequisite, but we've been somewhat flexible for practical reasons 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:47] <mdz> mdke: would you put it on the CC agenda?  I'll try to be there to discuss 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:48] <mdke> mdz, be happy to. 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:48] <mdke> it's two problems I suppose

ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:49] <Keybuk> I think we can just squeeze him in 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:49] <lifeless> thank you 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:49] <mdz> lifeless: care to introduce yourself? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:49] <lifeless> Hi, I'm lifeless 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:49] <sivang> he has a french dictionary named after him :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:49] <lifeless> I'm here hoping to get upload rights to universe as a MOTU 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:50] <ogra> yay 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:50] <ogra> lifeless,  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:50] <lifeless> indeed, the Robert-Collins dictionary 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:50] <ogra> often missed here 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:50] <lifeless> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RobertCollins describes most of the Ubuntu focused things I get up to 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:51] <mdz> lifeless: you maintain a few packages in Debian as well, yes? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:51] <mdz> ah, it's on your wiki page 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:51] <lifeless> yup, bicyclerepair, fl-cow, opensync, testresources 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:52] <mdz> lifeless: who sponsors the bzr uploads to ubuntu? jbailey? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:52] <Mithrandir> lifeless: I don't think Ubuntu runs well on S/360s.  I don't know about S/390s, though.. 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:52] <mdz> lifeless: do you do most of the packaging work for the uploads which go directly to ubuntu? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:52] <lifeless> mdz: yes. bzr is currently packaged by jbailey himself 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:53] <mdz> lifeless: are you a Debian developer, or does someone sponsor your uploads there? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:53] <lifeless> mdz: I'm a DD, though still a relatively new one 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:54] <sivang> lifeless: what about i5/OS ? ;-) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:54] <mdz> (I asked because your Maintainer fields don't have a debian.org address) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:54] <lifeless> I tend to get someone to eyeball my uploads if I'm working in a new area of packaging I'm not familiar with 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:54] <lifeless> mdz: ah. 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:54] <Keybuk> mdz: that's not so unusual?  When I was a DD, I never used my debian.org address 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:55] <mdz> Keybuk: not everyone does, but when they don't, it isn't immediately obvious whether they're a DD or not 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:55] <lifeless> this is true. I guess I think of myself as 'me' and as being a DD as one facet. 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:56] <mdz> and I'm far too lazy to go beyond apt-cache show to confirm ;-) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:56] <lifeless> its the same with canonical work, I usually use my home address except in rare circumstances 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:56] <Keybuk> lifeless: so, what makes you want to join the MOTU? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:56] <Keybuk> what about Ubuntu interests and excites you 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:56] <Keybuk> and what would you like to change and make better? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:57] <lifeless> so 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:57] <lifeless> I want to join MOTU to be able to complete the loop when I'm helping out in #ubuntu-motu 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:58] <lifeless> for instance, azeem and I want to make the mobile syncing stuff in ubuntu really rock for dapper +1 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:58] <lifeless> which is why we are working on all the opensync, discussing issues with upstream 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:58] <lifeless> and so on. 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:58] <mdz> lifeless: what are the issues there? I'm interested 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:59] <lifeless> mdz: multisync is essentially abandoned upstream, and the 'new' codebase 'opensync' is very unstable 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [10:59] <mdz> I want to be able to sync contacts between my phone and evolution, in particular 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [11:00] <mdz> does opensync have that sort of use case as a target? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [11:00] <lifeless> we've hit a number of issues in packaging - the test suite is location fragile 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [11:00] <lifeless> oh yes, thats exactly what opensync is about, multisync 0.8x may well do it already 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [11:01] <mdz> cool, maybe I'll find time to play with it one of these days 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [11:01] <Keybuk> would opensync also let me sync the evolution address book on my laptop with that on my desktop? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [11:01] <lifeless> but the multisync 0.8 ui is (at best) crackful - the 0.9 ui based on opensync should be much much better once it all comes together 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [11:01] <mjg59> Keybuk: Yes 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [11:01] <lifeless> Keybuk: yes 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [11:01] <lifeless> Keybuk: syncml + evo on the desktop, evo + syncml on the laptop 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [11:01] <mjg59> Synchronisation is something we've really been missing out on 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [11:02] <mdz> any further questions? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [11:02] <mdz> votes 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [11:03] <lifeless> answering what about ubuntu interests and excites me is rather hard - I find *everything* fascinating and interesting--- its just a matter of triaging down to the things I have time to actually look at 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [11:03] <mjg59> +1 based on past record and intention to work on important stuff 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [11:03] <mdz> +1 based on Debian history, sanity of existing packages, etc. 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [11:03] <Keybuk> +1 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [11:03] <Keybuk> even though he's at least partly responsible for Arch 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [11:03] <Keybuk> :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [11:04] <mdz> lifeless: congrats 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [11:04] <lifeless> I'm also 'at least partly responsible' for the solution! 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [11:04] <lifeless> mdz: thank you 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [11:04] <lifeless> thank you mjg59 and Keybuk too 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [11:04] <mdz> any other business before workrave strangles me? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [11:05] <mdke> mdz, I've added the agenda item for the CC 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-04-30 [11:05] <mdz> mdke: thanks

ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:02] <JaneW> hi sivang  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:02] <JaneW> edubuntu is in pretty good shape 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 === highvoltage can't wait 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:03] <highvoltage> edubuntu is great! 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:03] <jelkner> edubuntu is fantastic! 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 === ogra just created https://wiki.edubuntu.org/EdubuntuMeetingAgenda

ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:03] <ogra> stop now, i'm blushing :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:03] <jelkner> i have a quick question... 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:03] <ogra> shoot 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:03] <JaneW> we have it on the top of https://wiki.edubuntu.org/EdubuntuMeetingRecords too 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 === cbx33 imagines ogra's handsome face blushing :p 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:04] <jelkner> ogra: can you please tell me again how to chroot when you dist-upgrade to dapper? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:04] <ogra> JaneW, we need a dynamic agenda 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:04] <JaneW> ogra: agreed 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:04] <jelkner> or rather rebuilt the ltsp-chroot 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:04] <cbx33> I think it is becomming increasingly necessary 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:04] <ogra> jelkner, can we do that outside of the meeting ?  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:04] <highvoltage> jelkner: that's a question for #edubuntu :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:04] <jelkner> yes 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:04] <JaneW> esp with the edbuntu membership 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:04] <ogra> yep 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:05] <ogra> so from the tech side : 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 === highvoltage is interested to hear more about that 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:05] <ogra> not miuch to say, i'm merely busy with ubuntu bugs  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:05] <ogra> we decided to have an update for the beta CD, so beta2 might be released tomorrow 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:05] <JaneW> ogra: there a load of them though like 10k or such like... 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:05] <ogra> (i'm testing isos as i speak) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:05] <cbx33> nice,  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:06] <cbx33> I know ther are loads of bugs, I'm trying to help out where I can 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:06] <ogra> JaneW, yes, but that also includes whishlist and trivial bugs 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:06] <cbx33> but not so many specific edubuntu bugs 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:06] <cbx33> hehe 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:06] <ogra> the serious amount is way lower (but still to high) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:06] <JaneW> ogra: oic, does it look like serious bugs are manageable? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:06] <ogra> nope 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:06] <highvoltage> nope!? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:06] <JaneW> even with the new bug guy? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:06] <ogra> but we have simon now to care for our QA 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:07] <ogra> he will kick our butts if we dont get them solved in time ;) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:07] <sivang> hey highvoltage :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:07] <JaneW> ok, and I meant QA guy not bug guy 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:07] <cbx33> oh dear 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:07] <highvoltage> ogra: do we have a list of the most critical bugs in edubuntu? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:07] <highvoltage> hi sivang  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:07] <JaneW> although it's much of a muchness ;) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:07] <ogra> he will also assign edubuntu specific bugs to the new edubuntu bugsquad in launchpad instead of assigning them to me personally 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:07] <JaneW> highvoltage: I think that should read most critical bugs for edubuntu? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 === No1Viking [n=Viking@h-83-140-104-3.ip.cust.port80.se]  has joined #ubuntu-meeting 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:08] <ogra> so if you want to help bug triaging, subscribe to it  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:08] <JaneW> since we don't seem to have many IN edubuntu - right ogra? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:08] <JaneW> ogra: that's a good idea 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:08] <highvoltage> JaneW: right 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:08] <ogra> https://launchpad.net/people/edubuntu-bugs/+join 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:08] <JaneW> ogra: will anyone else help with those yet, or is that for future expansion? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:09] <ogra> JaneW, there isnt even a single bug assigned to that team yet 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:09] <highvoltage> blugtu and i wanted to get testing more formalised, we've been meaning to talk to ogra about that for the longest time 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:09] <ogra> and the overall count of edubuntu bugs is ~100 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:09] <ogra> err 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:09] <highvoltage> but schedule clashes have made that difficult 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:09] <ogra> ~10 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:09] <sivang> highvoltage: there a rough ubuntu test plans on the wiki, I reckon you could derive upon them and add the additional edubuntu / ltsp bits. 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:09] <highvoltage> testing and bug hunting / fixing probably goes hand in hand 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:09] <blugtu> yeah ,we need to create a first structure for the testing team 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:09] <cbx33> indeed 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:10] <highvoltage> sivang: noted 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:10] <JaneW> sivang: yes, but I think we have a very basic test plan... 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 === JaneW looks 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:10] <ogra> highvoltage, blugtu, cbx33 helped a lot with testing the beta isos ... he can give some hints ;) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:10] <ogra> JaneW, we only have a copied version of the ubuntu testplan 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:10] <cbx33> anything I can do guys 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:10] <sivang> highvoltage: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:10] <ogra> 90% of that stuff doesnt need testing in edubuntu 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:11] <ogra> we need to test other bits ... 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:11] <cbx33> I'm often testing on non-compliant hardware or older hardware 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:11] <JaneW> ogra: right ok we should get that customised then 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:11] <sivang> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/Long 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:11] <ogra> since if the things work in ubuntu and we didnt modify anything, they *must* work in edubuntu as well 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:11] <JaneW> cbx33: would you like to do that? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:11] <cbx33> sure 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:11] <ogra> in any case we rather need our owm testplans worked out ... 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:11] <cbx33> I'll give it a shot 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:12] <cbx33> indeed as you stated ogra most of the ubutnu stuff is tested else where 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:12] <JaneW> ogra: did you respond to the mail about our CD cover copy? is that signed off now> 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:12] <JaneW> ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:12] <blugtu> sivang: if you want to take a look to edubuntu testing team wiki , here it is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EdubuntuTestingTeam 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:12] <ogra> since it makes most sense to test the edubuntu specifics beyond the ubuntu install we test anyway 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:12] <JaneW> cbx33: excellent, thanks 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:12] <cbx33> totally agree 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:12] <cbx33> infact most of what I have been testing is non-ubu stuff anyway 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:12] <JaneW> we actaully need to go through the whole edubuntu wiki and do a springclean and update 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:12] <ogra> yes 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:12] <cbx33> because that's what I'm eventually oing to use it for 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:12] <cbx33> JaneW: agreeed 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:13] <ogra> we should do that around release or shortly before 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:13] <JaneW> to make sure the info is valid, current and well presented 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:13] <cbx33> make sure we get it all done in time 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:13] <sivang> ogra: agreed, however if someone edubuntu tests those bits, he can feed bugreports upstream to ubutnu as well :) (regardless of his edubuntu specific bits) Bt I agree this may be out of scope for edu ;-) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:13] <ogra> (what doesnt mean we shouldnt start already indeed ;) ) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:13] <sivang> blugtu: looking 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:13] <cbx33> ogra: :p 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:13] <blugtu> sivang:   ;) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:13] <JaneW> yes, and if you find any of my typos please correct them! 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:13] <ogra> sivang, yes, but i'm not intrested in reports about that, since we'll solve them in ubuntu anyway  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:13] <JaneW> we had one of my typos mentioned in a review last time :/ 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:14] <cbx33> JaneW: oh dear 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:14] <cbx33> :p 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:14] <sivang> ogra: sure :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:14] <cbx33> they're so unforgiving  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:14] <ogra> if your thin client bootsplash is wrong, thats something that intrests me, if openoffice is broken, i'm sure it will get solved in ubuntu anyway 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 === cbx33 bites his tongue 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:14] <cbx33> :p 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:15] <ogra> ok, so apart from that and still missing artwork/doc stuff edubuntu is fine 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:15] <JaneW> ogra: you feeling onfident we are on track and have enough testing so far that we won't have major surprises in the next 5 weeks? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:15] <cbx33> it makes perfect sense that way seeing as there are many more people to fix ubu spefiic bugs 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:15] <ogra> i have another topic, not tech related 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:15] <ogra> JaneW, yep 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:15] <JaneW> cool 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:15] <JaneW> ok the tech side is good, well done again! 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:16] <JaneW> ogra: you havent seen my whip for a while now :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:16] <ogra> i was approached independently by several people asking if we could rotate the meeting time  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:16] <JaneW> ogra: next? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:16] <cbx33> I can see why ogra  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:16] <cbx33> I'm lucky my boss actually wants me to attend these meetings 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:16] <JaneW> I am not commiting to another 4am meeting :( 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:17] <JaneW> ok who is this time really BAD for? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:17] <blugtu> for me its ok 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:17] <cbx33> ogra: will the introduction of the CC ease this issue? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:17] <blugtu> but wednesday its not a good day 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:17] <cbx33> having more people available to chair the meeting? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:17] <ogra> we said as long as nobody complains we want to stick to that time, but now with edubuntu membership and with community demand, i guess we should have at least two times to jump between 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:17] <highvoltage> JaneW: i would like a meeting that takes place out of office hours, so that i can attend it 100% 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:17] <JaneW> we have other meetings on Tues and Thurs 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:17] <highvoltage> JaneW: just as a question of preference 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:18] <JaneW> perhaps if we have 2 diff times which alternate each week, then at worst ppl attend every second meeting? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:18] <ogra> thats my plan 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:18] <cbx33> sounds good 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:18] <highvoltage> btw, http://distrowatch.com/index.php?dataspan=1 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:18] <JaneW> are we sticking to wednesday? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:18] <highvoltage> edubuntu #24 for last 7 days :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:18] <JaneW> WOW!!! 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:19] <ogra> so move the current one a bit earlier and have an alternate time for the evening 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:19] <highvoltage> JaneW: seems so 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:19] <JaneW> when Dapper releases we are going to storm the charts :)) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:19] <ogra> highvoltage, that will drop to nowhere with the new artwork :P 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:19] <JaneW> ok 10:00 UTC or earlier? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:19] <JaneW> ogra: :(((( 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:19] <JaneW> yes we need to discuss that 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:19] <ogra> 10:00 UTC sounds fine  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:19] <cbx33> earlier I'd like 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:20] <cbx33> ah ok :p 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:20] <JaneW> cbx33: what TZ are you? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:20] <JaneW> oh UK 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:20] <cbx33> GMT 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:20] <cbx33> :p 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:20] <blugtu> for me its not good 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:20] <blugtu> 10 utc 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:20] <ogra> what about 18:00 UTC for the other, is that to late for you JaneW ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:20] <JaneW> you get up early? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:20] <blugtu> so early 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:20] <cbx33> but it's ok 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:20] <highvoltage> ogra: we'll make lots of noise about that, I promise. that's bound to peak some interest in edubuntu though ;) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:20] <ogra> highvoltage, hopefully 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:20] <blugtu> ogra: 18 utc is perfect 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:20] <cbx33> that'd be great 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:21] <JaneW> ogra: too late for work day, and too early for night meeting I have to spend 5-8pm (my time with family and kids - sorry) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:21] <cbx33> ok 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:21] <cbx33> make it 22 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:21] <highvoltage> 18:00 utc is great for me too (but for the same reason it's bad for janew :/ ) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:21] <ogra> isnt 18:00 UTC 8pm for you ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:21] <cbx33> listen forget me...I can work around it 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:21] <JaneW> 20:00 UTC works for me 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:21] <cbx33> 20:00 is great for me 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:21] <blugtu> ogra: yes 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:21] <highvoltage> yeah, i think we can discuss this some other time in #edubuntu. 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:21] <highvoltage> wednesdays 12:00 is working Ok. 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:22] <cbx33> yes brilliantly 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:22] <JaneW> ogra: I can't really commit before 19:00 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:22] <ogra> UTC ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:22] <freeflying> 20:00 UTC is too early for asian 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:22] <JaneW> ok let's debate this on the mailing list of #edubuntu then? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:22] <cbx33> make it the late one then 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:22] <ogra> yep 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:22] <blugtu> JaneW: OK 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:23] <ogra> but it seems we have a tendency for 10:00 UTC and 20:00 UTC, right ?  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:23] <JaneW> I am UTC +2 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:23] <JaneW> ogra: yes that would work for me 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:23] <ogra> yep, as i am 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:23] <blugtu> 20 utc is good 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:23] <JaneW> on a wednesday? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:23] <ogra> ok, lets take these for the proposal and see what feedback we get 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:23] <ogra> yep 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:23] <ogra> lets keep the day 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:23] <JaneW> ogra: er that will suck on the day we have the 4am the next morning, but we'll cope :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:24] <ogra> i usually dont sleep before the 4am meeting, so i'm fine  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:24] <JaneW> yikes 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:24] <cbx33> heheh 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:24] <ogra> the question is if you can sort it 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:24] <cbx33> oh dear ogra  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:24] <JaneW> let's try that 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:24] <JaneW> so what time next week? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:24] <sivang> blugtu: according to what ogra said, why do yo have there a section about "Installation" ? this is already getting tested part of ubuntu no? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:24] <JaneW> 10:00? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:25] <ogra> JaneW, next week == first meeting in the month  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:25] <cbx33> sivang: no 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:25] <JaneW> ogra: yes 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:25] <cbx33> ther eare extra bits in the edubuntu installation 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:25] <sivang> cbx33: ah I see, ltsp related? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:25] <cbx33> yes 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:25] <ogra> we should take care for a third ECC member today as well 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:25] <JaneW> ogra: anything else? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:25] <ogra> yes, see above 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:26] <blugtu> sivang: yep but we will see for details during a testing meeting 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:26] <JaneW> take care? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:26] <ogra> vote, elect 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:26] <Riddell> ECC? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:26] <JaneW> we'll discuss the ECC election next week no? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:26] <ogra> or do we want to sort that on the first ECC ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:26] <sivang> ECC? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:26] <ogra> Riddell, edubuntu CC 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:26] <freeflying> Riddell: we'd have KCC :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:26] <ogra> Riddell, like the KCC ;) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:26] <JaneW> ogra: do we need to discuss the process or what? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:27] <ogra> JaneW, i guess we need to *define* a process first  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:27] <JaneW> ogra: ahh 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:27] <JaneW> ogra: mailing list discussion? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:27] <ogra> yep 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:27] <cbx33> self nomination, seconded, vote, elect ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:27] <JaneW> or here and now? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:27] <JaneW> cbx33: yep sounds good 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:27] <ogra> sounds very good 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:27] <cbx33> :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:27] <blugtu> i quote cbx33 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:27] <JaneW> ogar: think we must follow CC processes as far as possible 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:28] <JaneW> ogar! lol 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:28] <cbx33> heheh 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:28] <ogra> JaneW, not for the ECC itself 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:28] <ogra> but for the member approval 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:28] <JaneW> ogra: yes that's what I meant 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:29] <sivang> ogra: special TB/CC per each derivative? :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 === ogra adds a membership candidates section to the new agenda page 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:29] <JaneW> ok the new WEB SITE, highvoltage any news on that? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:29] <JaneW> ogra: thanks 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:30] <highvoltage> JaneW: been talking to Znarl in PM... he's on it 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:30] <JaneW> highvoltage: excellent, got an ETA yet? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:30] <highvoltage> JaneW: i'll ask him quickly 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:30] <JaneW> highvoltage: we can let it slip in unnoticed 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 === klaidas [n=klaidas@unaffiliated/klaidas]  has joined #ubuntu-meeting 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:31] <highvoltage> JaneW: what do you mean? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:31] <highvoltage> oh, right 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:31] <cbx33> hehe :p 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:32] <highvoltage> JaneW: i've been in contact with znarl over the weekend and monday, yesterday, and today, so it's unlikely to just slip by unnoticed. 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:32] <JaneW> can=can't sorry 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:32] <JaneW> highvoltage: cool ok thanks 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:32] <JaneW> can't wait 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:32] <JaneW> :)) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:32] <cbx33> w00t 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:32] <highvoltage> pips1 and i will still make lots of changes to it in the future 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:32] <JaneW> we are still waiting for final dapper artwork 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:32] <ogra> if you want to apply for membership, please add yourself at the bottom of https://wiki.edubuntu.org/EdubuntuMeetingAgenda 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 === highvoltage needs to run, wil try to pop in again before end of meeting 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:33] <cbx33> cya highvoltage  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:33] <JaneW> I think it's being kept largely under wraps till closer to the release 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:33] <JaneW> bye highvoltage  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:33] <cbx33> JaneW: any news on the artwork theme yet? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:33] <blugtu> cya highvoltage 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:33] <JaneW> but it looks like our default theme is going to be the chalkboard one 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:33] <JaneW> which is dark green 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:33] <ogra> which i strongly oppose 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 === JaneW too for the record 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:34] <highvoltage> JaneW: i haven't seen it yet, but if ogra's unhappy with it, then so am i! 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 === cbx33 again 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:34] <JaneW> we are still free to provide nice alternatives for the 'Young' theme 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:34] <ogra> yes, i didnt recieve any wallpaper yet 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:34] <cbx33> JaneW: but not the default? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:34] <JaneW> cbx33: right 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:34] <ogra> but changing to chalkboard will mean to redo *all* themes 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:34] <ogra> else the colors bite 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:35] <cbx33> it is a real shame that this is being forced upon us 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:35] <JaneW> I don't HATE the chalkboard one, but I definitely don't love it, and I don;t think it does anything to help build our brand 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:35] <ogra> yes 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:35] <cbx33> any chance of a petition? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:35] <JaneW> we can try that yes 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:35] <cbx33> or an appeal 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:35] <ogra> cbx33, JaneW and i did what we could  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:35] <cbx33> I understand 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:35] <cbx33> Wish I could jump on the band wagon too 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:35] <JaneW> ogra and I are powerless alone, but if we have community support that may carry more weight 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:35] <ogra> so its up to the community i guess 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:36] <ogra> which we are not allowed to show the theme  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:36] <JaneW> ogra: are we def not allowed to show it? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:36] <JaneW> I am not clear about that... 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:36] <cbx33> what is the issue here? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:37] <ogra> no idea, but its not much different from https://wiki.edubuntu.org/EdubuntuDapperTheme/JonathanCarter/chalk 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:37] <JaneW> ogra: hehe clever 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:37] <ogra> its a little brighter and has more chalk leftovers on it ...

ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:38] <cbx33> ogra: it just seems very old fashioned 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:38] <JaneW> so like I said before if you have anything better SEND it to us 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:38] <ogra> yes

ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:38] <cbx33> what about swapping it for an interactive whiteboard :p 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:38] <JaneW> we can;t complain unless we have alternatives 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 === klaidas [n=klaidas@unaffiliated/klaidas]  has left #ubuntu-meeting ["=)"]  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:38] <cbx33> hehe 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:38] <cbx33> I can do what I can 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:39] <cbx33> my wife is a website designer, I can get her to give it a shot if you want 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:39] <cbx33> she's pretty good with that kind of thing 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:39] <JaneW> cbx33: yes please! 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:39] <ogra> we wanted to stay with the current bright and colorful theme, but were told by our coo that it isnt recognized as edubuntu branding yet 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:39] <cbx33> oh it will be 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:39] <cbx33> if it's the last thing I do :p 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:39] <ogra> (which we both disagree about) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:39] <cbx33> It;s a gear theme 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:40] <cbx33> *great 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:40] <JaneW> cbx33: see this http://art.ubuntu.com/backgrounds/edubuntu/ 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:40] <cbx33> and brands it well 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:40] <cbx33> JaneW: do you have any tips/guidence on what we like/don;t like 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:40] <cbx33> a design brief I suppose I could pass on to her 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:40] <JaneW> we like edubuntu girl but were hoping for more diversity, since that was an issue last time, so were looking at something like 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:41] <cbx33> ok 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:41] <JaneW> http://art.ubuntu.com/images/backgrounds/Edubuntu-Children_Of_Edubuntu_1024x768.png 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:41] <ogra> the goal was to appear more grown up than in last release 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:41] <JaneW> perhaps a bit subtler though 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:41] <cbx33> I see what you mean 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:41] <cbx33> it's nice, but it looses the brainding i feel 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:41] <ogra> we wanted a more neutral wallpaper, but still bright and friendly 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:41] <cbx33> ogra: totally agree with you there 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:41] <JaneW> ogra: for the default yes, but we still want a fun and naive young option 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:42] <cbx33> i think quite a clean background with a definite theme would be nice 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:42] <JaneW> edubuntu girls with her new diverse friends? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:42] <ogra> yes, the young one can look like edubuntu girl or the children of edubuntu 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:42] <cbx33> hehehe 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:42] <cbx33> I'll get her started tonight, she'll do her best I know it 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:43] <ogra> :)

ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:44] <cbx33> heheh 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:44] <JaneW> yes but it wasn't released 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:44] <cbx33> any more thoughts on artwork? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:44] <JaneW> and we replaced it with the fun young one 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:44] <ogra> it was pre mustard :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:44] <JaneW> :P 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:44] <cbx33> pre-mustard hahaha

ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:46] <ogra> nah ... 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:47] <cbx33> maybe we culd use a picture of hip hop ogra in his mustard attire for the background 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:47] <ogra> they are black i wouldnt wear colored leather 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:47] <ogra> haha 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:47] <Mithrandir> we could just color rotate the image and they'd be mustard. 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:47] <cbx33> right, next? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [02:48] <ogra> Mithrandir, heh ... "different kinds of mustard" :)

ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:44] <janimo> freeflying: so right now by default CJK users cannot type in native language on ubuntu/kubuntu becaus ethese ar enot on the CD? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:44] <janimo> I see there are two chinese one korean and one japanese right? the four packages you mentioned 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:44] <freeflying> janimo: ya, guys need download the language support packages 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:45] <janimo> freeflying: oh, so what is the improvement in dapper regarding asian languages? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 === zell1983 [n=zell1983@host30-78.pool8258.interbusiness.it]  has left #ubuntu-meeting ["L']  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:45] <janimo> working just not fitting on CD? did they not even work ok so far? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:45] <freeflying> janimo: guys needn't configure anymore 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:45] <janimo> oh, you needed to tweak X/fontconfig and such? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:45] <freeflying> if they choose download language suppot package , everything is okey 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:46] <freeflying> janimo: needn't  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:46] <janimo> besides these which are input methods, is there anything missing right now from xubuntu default? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:46] <janimo> fonts? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:46] <freeflying> the are in desktop seeds 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:47] <janimo> ok I'll add these 4 packages to xubuntu-desktop, seems to be 4Mb total 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:47] <freeflying> janimo: if you have enough space , include language-pack-gnome-CJK would be better  :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:48] <janimo> freeflying: there's no other reason for them not being on the ubuntu CD right? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:48] <janimo> like quality issues ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:48] <freeflying> janimo: no others 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:48] <janimo> I guess not if they're in main 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:48] <freeflying> no 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 === JanC [n=janc@lugwv/member/JanC]  has joined #ubuntu-meeting 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:48] <janimo> freeflying: language-pack gnome ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:48] <janimo> that's mostly for gnome apps right? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:48] <janimo> granted abiword is in there too and gaim 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:49] <freeflying> janimo: then what for xfce4's i18n ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:49] <janimo> freeflying: those are small enough (a few 100Kb per language) that are put directly in the base langpacks 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:49] <janimo> no more than 300K/lang 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:50] <freeflying> janimo: then language-support-CJk 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:50] <janimo> so if CHK have translated xfce they're in :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:50] <janimo> freeflying: sure 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:50] <janimo> till now I did not put in anything besides what's in ubuntu 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:50] <janimo> to keep the CD easily downloadable 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:50] <freeflying> janimo: with these , CJK user needn't download exrta package  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:50] <janimo> but I'll add many langpacks 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:50] <freeflying> that's great 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:50] <janimo> the top 10 languages' lang support seem to total 120-130 Mb  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:51] <janimo> that fits I think even with OOo on the CD 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:51] <freeflying> janimo: CJK is in top 10? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:51] <janimo> well mandarin sure is :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:51] <janimo> top 1 I think :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:51] <janimo> but yes I fon;t recall the ubutu classification 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:51] <janimo> let me check

ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:52] <freeflying> janimo: xubuntu has abiword ,why include OOo 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:52] <janimo> http://people.ubuntu.com/~cjwatson/seeds/xubuntu-dapper/ship 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:52] <janimo> freeflying: OOo is not installed just on the CD. since it fits 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:53] <janimo> I got the impression from a bengali translator that, besides OOo no free office is usable in indian langauges 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:53] <janimo> is that not the same for CJK? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:53] <freeflying> janimo: as to me , xubuntu shall use light program like goffice instead of OOo 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:54] <janimo> freeflying: I agree that it's lighter and that's the default 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:54] <janimo> but does abiword support CJK/indic languages? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:54] <freeflying> janimo: not too well 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:54] <janimo> so what do chinese users who prefer not to write in English do? :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:55] <janimo> they need OOo I guess 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:55] <freeflying> abiword can write in CJK 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:55] <freeflying> but not so fine as OOo dose 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:55] <janimo> most popular languages according to ubuntu classification: zh es bn hi ar xh pt ru ja de fr 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:55] <janimo> so chinese support will be on CD definitely 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:55] <freeflying> nice :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:56] <janimo> ok what do we have on our agenda today? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:56] <janimo> not on the wiki of course since that's empty :)

ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:57] <nomed> janimo: we'll need an xubuntu-icons-theme within artwork 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:57] <nomed> for sure 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:57] <janimo> what theme does tha tuse? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:58] <nomed> there will be really few but needed anyway 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:58] <janimo> are those new icons made for xubuntu? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:58] <nomed> yes 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:58] <janimo> can they be part of tango itself? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:58] <nomed> not all of them but some 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:58] <nomed> no 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:58] <janimo> what is the reason for not? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:58] <nomed> the xubuntu specific ones no 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:58] <nomed> just generic icons 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:59] <janimo> there is a sound icon in tango already and does not look like that (whistle) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:59] <nomed> but i have still to talk to dobay about this 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:59] <janimo> what is the situation in current mcs-manager? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:59] <nomed> dobey even 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:59] <janimo> where does it fallback to? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:59] <nomed> orrible 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:59] <ogra> did you guys see that you are at place 4 on distrowatch ?

ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:59] <janimo> yes, but more techinaclly? :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:59] <freeflying> janimo: dose xubntu has a network-con tool  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:59] <nomed> i'll write a mail to xfce-devel 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:59] <ogra> (for the 7 day stats) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:59] <janimo> ogra, yeah somewhat under our expectations ;) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [03:59] <Gloubiboulga> ogra, yep :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 === ..[topic/#ubuntu-meeting:Ubugtu] : Current meeting: Xubuntu | Calendar: http://fridge.ubuntu.com/event | Logs: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/ | 27 Apr 20:00 UTC: Ubuntu Development Team | 27 Apr 22:00 UTC: Kubuntu | 03 May 12:00 UTC: Edubuntu | 04 May 02:00 UTC: Ubuntu Development Team | 10 May 12:00 UTC: Edubuntu 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:00] <ogra> janimo, well, its hard to beat ubuntu :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:00] <janimo> nomed, writing to xfce devel would be really great 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:00] <janimo> ogra, ;) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:00] <nomed> janimo: tecnically xfce-mcs-setting is the devil 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:00] <janimo> but really I think xubuntu is overhyped :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 === janimo talks like a gentoo zealot 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:01] <nomed> it can use icons that don't exist 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:01] <nomed> :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:01] <ogra> janimo, it has buntu in its name, thats ebnough for a hype :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:01] <janimo> nomed, if upstrem could fix that code to use saner icon names which can be found in tango/icon-spec we'd be further ahead 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:01] <janimo> I'd prefer that instead of changing tango to some other theme at this point 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:01] <janimo> and possibly incur other breakage 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:02] <janimo> or even have poeple not like it 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:02] <janimo> ogra, and an X. Never underestimate the power of the letter X in marketing 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:02] <nomed> janimo: you do not need to change tango 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:02] <janimo> most of the reason why XMl is popular IMHO 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:02] <ogra> hehe 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:02] <janimo> nomed, so tango will be the fallbak? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:02] <nomed> they need to fix that issue 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:03] <janimo> look in xubuntu first then fallback to tango? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:03] <nomed> janimo: back to the beginning :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:03] <janimo> if so does that not mean less performance? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:03] <nomed> xubuntu icons theme in xubuntu-artwork :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:03] <nomed> fallback --> tango 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:03] <nomed> anyway the dialog icons issue is still there 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:03] <nomed> as those icons are hardcoded 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:04] <janimo> nomed, ok please write to xfce-devel about this 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:04] <nomed> the only solution at the moment is to patch source  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:04] <janimo> I suppose they'd like to fix that too 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:04] <janimo> as they seem to use tango 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:04] <nomed> me too 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:04] <janimo> indeed the mcs manager is out of sync with the rest if I think about it 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:04] <nomed> i'll continue a thread that  got 43 answers :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:04] <janimo> ok :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:04] <nomed> it was at a good point :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:04] <janimo> they seemed positive generally right? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:04] <nomed> absolutely yes 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:05] <janimo> I am looking at desktop icons in the meantime 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:05] <janimo> launchers and removable media 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:05] <janimo> nomed, ok thanks.let's see what they say and then go on. 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:05] <nomed> i would see even hd .. not removable ..

ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:06] <janimo> nomed, I mean behaviour 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:06] <janimo> they do not automatically show up and things like that 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:06] <nomed> uhhh .. 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:06] <nomed> k 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:06] <janimo> in the meantime talk to dobey if it's possible to get some of these into tango itslef 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:06] <nomed> janimo: i'm sure there is a bug on that code 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:06] <janimo> makes our job easier long term 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:06] <janimo> nomed, yes there is 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:06] <nomed> janimo: yes it's possible 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:06] <janimo> but brian/benny don't havetoo much time to debug 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:06] <nomed> i have already the legacy xml file 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:07] <janimo> especially sine it seems to work for them 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:07] <nomed> ao it may depend on dbus 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:07] <nomed> s/ao/so 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:08] <nomed> ahh and tango upstreamer will include that patch as soon as i send it to him 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:08] <nomed> i'm just waiting a steady state :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:08] <janimo> great :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:08] <janimo> than daniel will upload it to ubuntu and we're better  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:09] <nomed> i think then some artist should play with xubuntu images  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:09] <nomed> they need to be all fixed 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:10] <janimo> which images? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:10] <janimo> current artwork? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:10] <nomed> wallpaper, usplash, logo and so on 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:10] <janimo> hmm do you not like jmak's work? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:10] <nomed> they 're done but they've even small issues 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:11] <janimo> he is the single artist so far who actively participated 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:11] <janimo> since the beginning 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:11] <nomed> janimo: the usplash could be strongly improved 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:11] <janimo> nomed I agree but usplash looks ugly because of small res no? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:11] <nomed> not really 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:11] <janimo> although ubuntu usplash is nicer  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:11] <nomed> it's while the artist convert the image to an idexed one 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:12] <nomed> it's possible to get a really better resolution 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:12] <janimo> aha 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:12] <nomed> i've seen images on 16c that were the same as the original one 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:12] <janimo> we may need to tell jmak how to actually test the usplash so he sees the result himself 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:12] <nomed> that depends on how the artist can use gimp inkscape and such apps 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 === luzi_away is now known as luzi 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:13] <luzi> the problem with usplash is not resolution, it's the 16 colors! 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:13] <nomed> luzi yes 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:13] <nomed> but ex 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:13] <nomed> the usplash i checked had a color map with a lot of red and pink 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:13] <nomed> and i don't see red or pink in xubuntu usplash 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:14] <nomed> that means the palette could be optimized 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:14] <nomed> and consequentely the image resolution 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 === dsas [n=dean@host81-158-82-72.range81-158.btcentralplus.com]  has joined #ubuntu-meeting 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:14] <nomed> if you have 16 c .. 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:14] <nomed> but you use just 4 c from that palette ... 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:15] <janimo> nomed, please talk to jozsef or luzi about this and see if you can sort it out 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:15] <janimo> and when you're all satisfied I'll upload :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:15] <nomed> janimo: i wrote a mail  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:15] <janimo> ok 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:16] <nomed> but i need they contact me or just replay :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:16] <nomed> luzi if you're fine with it we can talk a bit at #xubuntu later 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:16] <luzi> ok 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:17] <nomed> luzi there is a small issue on the official xubuntu logo  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:17] <nomed> have u seen it .. 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:17] <nomed> ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:17] <luzi> what issue? 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:18] <nomed> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperXubuntuLogo 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:18] <nomed> take a look on the left part of that circle :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:18] <nomed> maybe it's me ...  
ubuntu-meeting 2006-05-01 [04:18] <mjg59> It looks like the "head" is offset from the "body"
