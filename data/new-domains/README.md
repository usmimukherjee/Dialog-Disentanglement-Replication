This folder contains files from the paper [Chat Disentanglement: Data for New Domains and Methods for More Accurate Annotation](), by Sai R. Gouravajhala, Andrew M. Vernier, Yiming Shi, Zihan Li, Mark Ackerman, Jonathan K. Kummerfeld.

The 24 files provide annotations for 2,400 lines of annotated IRC data, and 12,000 for context:

- 4 channels
- 3 samples from each channel
- 200 lines of annotated data, with 1,000 preceding lines as context.

The format is the same as for the earlier data. However, these IRC channels have slightly different logs:
