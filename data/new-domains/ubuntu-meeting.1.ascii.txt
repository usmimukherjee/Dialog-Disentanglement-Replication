ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:01] <sabdfl> hello all 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:01] <dholbach> good morning 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:01] <dholbach> Technoviking: nice, you made it 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:01] <dholbach> hey sabdfl, hi pleia2 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:01] <dholbach> I'd say that's quorum already - who else do we have here? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:02] <sabdfl> Technoviking: morning :-) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:02] <dholbach> I have a bad internet connection here, can anybody else lead the meeting? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:03] <dholbach> AFAICS we have two agenda items on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommunityCouncilAgenda (no mdke here for the wiki licensing and U1 shouldn't really be on the agenda anymore) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:03] <popey> o/ 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:03] <dholbach> hey popey 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:03] <pleia2> hey popey 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:04] <dholbach> any volunteers for running the meeting? :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:04] <sabdfl> i'm happy to do so 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:04] <sabdfl> welcome, new CC 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:04] <popey> Ahoi hoi! 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:04] <sabdfl> can we remove the one.ubuntu.com item? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:05] <sabdfl> it was for information purposes, and everyone is now aware of it 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:05]  * dholbach removes is 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:05] <dholbach> it 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:05] <sabdfl> ok. we're skipping the team wiki issue till mdke joins us 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:05] <sabdfl> CoC - any thoughts before we move to a vote? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:06] <sabdfl> ok 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:06] <sabdfl> daniel, can you drive the vote please? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:06] <sabdfl> my mootbotfu is not up to it

ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:07] <dholbach> [TOPIC] Proposed CoC changes 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:07] <MootBot> New Topic:  Proposed CoC changes 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:07] <dholbach> is http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~mako/ubuntu-codeofconduct/proposed-revision/files the right link? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:07] <popey> are we merely voting on its acceptance as the new CoC or its implementation? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:08] <sabdfl> just voting on the text 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:08] <popey> ok 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:08] <sabdfl> dholbach: technically we should point to a particular revision on the branch 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:08] <dholbach> I don't think it's the right branch 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:08] <Technoviking> dholbach: that point to revision 8, sabdfl made a 9th revision 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:08] <dholbach> my internet is just so slow here 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:08] <dholbach> so it takes me ages to find it

ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:09] <dholbach> can everybody double-check? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:09] <sabdfl> it was rev 9 on *my* branch, but mako merged it in as rev 8 on his 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:09] <sabdfl> it's accurate as it stands

ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:10] <popey> that one? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:10] <sabdfl> dholbach: nothing material - the mako link is the correct one 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:10] <dholbach> ok great

ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:11] <sabdfl> thanks all, we have an updated CoC 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:12] <dholbach> I'm happy we finally did that :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:12] <sabdfl> popey: want to talk implementation? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:12] <dholbach> hey mako 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 === simon-o|lunch is now known as simon-o 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:12] <mako> sorry i'm a little late 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:13] <sabdfl> np 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:13] <sabdfl> mako, we just voted on and approved the new CoC per your rev 8 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:13] <popey> I'd like to see a system whereby it's clear which verion of the CoC someone signed 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:13] <sabdfl> agreed 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:13] <mako> oh, wonderful 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:13] <popey> and allow people to 'upgrade' their signature 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:13] <dholbach> is there a launchpad bug/blueprint open for that? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:13] <mako> needless to say (and for the record), i am also in favor 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:13] <popey> or elect not to 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:13] <sabdfl> i believe this is tracked in LP already, but we don't have flows around upgrading or displaying it 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:14] <sabdfl> popey: can you chat with curtis hovey about that? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:14] <popey> sure 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:14] <sabdfl> he's in US timezones 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:14] <sabdfl> i think the real plan is to generalise it, so any project can publish agreements / terms / sla's and we track who's agreed to what 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:14] <popey> that would be useful 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:15] <dholbach> that sounds great 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:15] <dholbach> anything else on the topic of CoC? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:15] <sabdfl> sounds like a swamp of legalese to me, but hey, full speed ahead :-) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:15] <dholbach> :-) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:15] <popey> heh 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:15] <sabdfl> dholbach: will you publish it in all the right places? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:15] <mako> that seems like a minor issue. and in general, we want to avoid having to deal with arguments like, "well, i only agreed to version 1.0 of the CoC, not 1.1" 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:16] <popey> but we equally don't want people to say 'Hey, I never signed up for that!' 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:16] <mako> that's certainly not a reason to not check 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:16] <popey> GPL v2 or later .. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:16] <sabdfl> i would like to have a stab at generalising the CoC, so that other projects don't have to fork it 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:16] <Technoviking> someone should publishize it to the Planet 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:16] <dholbach> sabdfl: I'll talk to newz2000 to get it on ubuntu.com - not sure wherelse it needs to go 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:16] <dholbach> sabdfl: but I'll have a look 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:16] <sabdfl> so, that can be a goal for a CoC 2.0 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:16] <sabdfl> Technoviking: go ahead and blog it! 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:16] <pleia2> Technoviking: I can 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:16] <pleia2> or you :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:17] <dholbach> both! 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:17] <dholbach> :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:17] <sabdfl> for the moment, i think we're wrapped on that front 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:17] <Technoviking> sweet 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:17] <dholbach> cool 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:17] <popey> heh fill the front page with verbatim copies of the CoC :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:17] <pleia2> dholbach: can you let me know when you have it "published in all the right places"? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:17] <popey> (front page of the planet) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:17] <mako> sabdfl: ah! emma jane and i already have a branch where we started working on that 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:17] <sabdfl> dholbach: want to introduce CommunityCouncil/Delegation/Proposal ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:17] <dholbach> pleia2: will do - I'll file a bug and subscribe you 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:17] <pleia2> dholbach: great, thanks! 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:17] <dholbach> [TOPIC] Clarify expectations of Team Councils and Boards 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:17] <MootBot> New Topic:  Clarify expectations of Team Councils and Boards 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:17] <dholbach> sabdfl: sure 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:18] <sabdfl> cool mako! i didn't have any great insight other than the need to generalise so if you're working on it i'm +1 and won't interfere 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:18] <dholbach> we've grown a lot of team councils and boards in the Ubuntu community already and it seems like a good idea to clarify expectations for those governance bodies 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:19] <dholbach> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommunityCouncil/Delegation/Proposal is very common, very simple steps to try to go forward and expect similar things of all of them 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:19] <dholbach> if we can agree on it, I'd like to add merge https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommunityCouncil/Delegation/Proposal  into https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommunityCouncil/Delegation 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:20] <sabdfl> i think it could be fleshed out a bit more 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:20] <sabdfl> not sure if it's best for me to do that right now, or later 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:20] <dholbach> sabdfl: what parts are you thinking of? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:20] <sabdfl> but i'd like to see more specific articulation of the general model: 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:21] <sabdfl>  - governance boards (policy, dispute resolution) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:21] <sabdfl>  - ops (moderators in forums, ops in irc, general uploaders in the dev team, etc) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:21] <mako> dholbach: so i've seen this before and there's nothing in there that i find problematic 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:21] <sabdfl>  - members (substantial contributors) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:22] <sabdfl> that's a structural pattern that isn't clear to me from this doc 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:22]  * mako nods to sabdfl 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:22] <sabdfl> it's not rigid, but i would like to see the pattern articulated somewhere 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 === porthose|afk is now known as porthose 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:22] <sabdfl> dholbach: will you lead the discussion while i have a stab at that in the document? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:22] <sabdfl> apologies for real-time editing :-/ 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:22] <dholbach> sure, that all sounds good to me 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:23] <jono> I am happy to help with this too if needed, dholbach 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:23] <dholbach> pleia2, Technoviking, popey: do you have any other comments on the proposal? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:23] <popey> no 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:23] <pleia2> no, looks good 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:23] <Technoviking> fine here 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:25] <dholbach> I agree with sabdfl - having team councils approve members is a great way to build a community and recognise great contributions 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:25] <jono> agreed 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:25] <dholbach> and mentioning dispute resolution makes sense too 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:25] <dholbach> I think we have a document about that on the wiki already 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:25] <dholbach> something in the BuildingCommunity/ namespace? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:26] <dholbach> can somebody help me find it? maybe we could link to it as a "howto" 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:26] <jono> about councils approving members? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:26] <dholbach> no, sorry, dispute resolution 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:26] <jono> oh right 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:26] <dholbach> for membership wiki.u.c/Membership should be good enough 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:26] <jono> I remember writing something up about it a long time back 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:26] <jono> I will see if I can find it 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:27] <pleia2> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CodeOfConductGuidelines links to an unratified Dispute Resolution document 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:27] <dholbach> my internet is dog-slow here, so don't wait on me finding it :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:27] <pleia2> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CodeOfConductDisputeResolution 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:28] <dholbach> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BuildingCommunity/DealingWithConflict is what I was thinking of 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:29] <mako> yeah, the second links looks a bit more threshed out 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:29] <jono> dholbach, thats the doc I was thinking of too 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:29] <dholbach> jono: I updated it a few weeks ago and linked it from a few other places too 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:29] <jono> I could also take my conflict chapter from The art of community and put there there too 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:29] <dholbach> sure, that'd be good 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:30] <dholbach> so https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BuildingCommunity/DealingWithConflict looks good to all of you? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:31] <popey> yeah, I'd not seen that page before.. it's pretty good 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:31] <dholbach> cool, it'd be good if we could refer to a "howto" from the delegation page 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:31] <popey> could do with a couple of exit points for where the process fails 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:32] <popey> e.g. 'get everyone on irc', if people refuse to join, or evade meetings.. what to do next 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:32] <dholbach> maybe Jono's book chapter has more detail? :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:33] <jono> dholbach, it does 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:33] <jono> it talkes through a conflict resolution scenario too 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:33] <dholbach> good 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:33] <dholbach> I'm not so sure what sabdfl meant when he mentioned "policy" - so I'd wait for him to re-emerge from the wiki editing 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:33] <jono> I will see if I can chop out the chapter and put it online 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:33] <dholbach> thanks jono 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:33] <jono> :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:34] <dholbach> does anybody have thoughts about the structure of moderators in forums, ops in irc, general uploaders in the dev team, etc 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:34] <dholbach> ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:35] <jono> what do you mean? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:35] <dholbach> sabdfl:  mentioned it above 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:35] <dholbach> err 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:35] <dholbach> sabdfl mentioned it above 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:35] <mako> i mean, i don't have any general comments beyond the fact that they should be people who can/do satisify the requirements laid out in the LCoC 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:35] <pleia2> I'd need to hear more from the specific teams about what they think the structure should be 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:36] <jussi01> Thats a pretty broad group there. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:36] <sabdfl> take a look at what's there now, folks, is it headed in the right direction? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:37] <dholbach> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommunityCouncil/Delegation/Proposal?action=diff&rev2=8&rev1=6 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:37] <jono> sabdfl, looks good to me 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:38] <jono> I feel like we also need to link to a page detailing meeting best practise 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:38] <jono> how to run a meeting, essentially 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:38] <jono> we can check into this 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:39] <sabdfl> ok, i will finish this edit in a while if you are all happy with the direction 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:39] <pleia2> these changes look good so far 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:39] <dholbach> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BuildingCommunity/TeamReporting https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BuildingCommunity/TeamIrcSessions probably 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:39] <Technoviking> looks good to me 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:39] <dholbach> sabdfl: I'm happy with it too 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:39] <sabdfl> i will include those links, dholbach 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:39] <dholbach> super 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:40] <jono> sounds good 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:40] <mako> best practice stuff is great. councils should have as many of those sorts of resources 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:40] <dholbach> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BuildingCommunity/KnowledgeBase has a lot of good stuff :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:40] <jono> indeed :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:40] <mako> but we should be clear to distinguish best practices from policies and guidelines. our guidlines should be as small as possible and as reactive as we can 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:40] <dholbach> maybe we should also mention the team-council mailing list or whatever it's called? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:41] <dholbach> mako: agreed, that should be clear 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:41] <sabdfl> i think it's already there, i'll bolster it a little 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:41] <jussi01> Just one thing slightly related to that delegation page, (if its inappropriate for now pull me up) is there a reason we only get people to sign the CoC and not sign the LCoC? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:41] <jono> dholbach, it is in there 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:42] <dholbach> jono: ok cool 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:42] <jono> I am planning a few posts there this week 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:42] <dholbach> jussi01: I'm happy to take somebody's "word of honour" for it as soon as they step up as a leader 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:42] <dholbach> I personally don't think we need a technical implementation for it 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:42] <pleia2> at the end of the the CoC there is a clause about leaders being required to follow the LCoC 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:42] <dholbach> ah cool :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:43] <jussi01> oh, I didnt notice that. :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:43] <dholbach>  #include <lcoc>    :-) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:43] <jussi01> hehe 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:43] <dholbach> maybe a word about sharing best-practices on https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/team-council-members ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:43] <dholbach> but maybe that's too obvious :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:44] <jono> dholbach, indeed 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:44]  * popey wasnt aware of that list 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:44] <jono> I would like to encourage people to use that list as a means of sharing best practice as well as asking for help with governance issues 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:44] <jono> popey, this reminds me, we need to ensure the new CC is on 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:44] <pleia2> popey: I wasn't either :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:45] <jono> popey, it is a list for Ubuntu community governance board members 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:45] <jono> pleia2, popey I will add you if that is ok? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:45] <pleia2> jono: yes, thank you 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:45] <jono> np 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:46] <dholbach> anything else you want to include/change on  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommunityCouncil/Delegation/Proposal ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:46] <popey> jono: sure 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:46] <jono> cool 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:46] <popey> alan@popey.com 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:46] <jono> dholbach, looks good, I think it hits the main points 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:46] <jussi01> dholbach: you may want to actually ad the address for the tem council list there? or a link to the lists.ubuntu.com page for it 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:47] <dholbach> jussi01: I think sabdfl is editing right now 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:50] <sabdfl> ok, take a look now 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:50] <sabdfl> sorry for the deep dive on the doc 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:50] <dholbach> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommunityCouncil/Delegation/Proposal?action=diff&rev2=9&rev1=6 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:51] <jono> this looks good sabdfl 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:52]  * dholbach fixes a typo and adds https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/team-council-members 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:52] <jono> sorry folks, I need to run back to the apartment, ready for my call with dholbach in 8mins 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:52] <jono> I will be back soon 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:54] <dholbach> I'm happy with it 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:54]  * dholbach waits for it to save 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [12:54] <dholbach> if nobody spots anything urgent, shall we proceed to vote?

ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:06] <lool> I dont know why you said that last week

ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:07] <lool> [14:21] <ogra> lool, are you trying to run a karmic ext4 fs with a jaunty kernel ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:07] <ogra> before we discussed it 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:07] <ogra> yeah 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:07] <lool> For some reason you seemed to believe that was fsck related but it's not

ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:08] <plars> I nominated a few more, but I need to talk to the QA guys again about getting the ability to do that 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:08] <ogra> can you give a list to someon who can ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:08] <plars> for now, best to look at the subscribed list

ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:12] <lool> Yes 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:12] <StevenK> If that's an arm package, ENOHARDWARE 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:12] <ogra> apart from the producer i mean :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:12] <GrueMaster> I did some testing.  I don't have a lot of test videos, but what I do have seemed to play ok, even from an NFS share. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:13] <lool> I asked for testing on any arch and got some 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:13] <ogra> StevenK, right, but dyfet NCommander plars JamieBennett or GrueMaster could test 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:13] <lool> plars reported that performance did not improve on non-NEON hardware which is ok 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:13]  * NCommander hangs his head 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:13] <lool> and it was pushed to karmic so it is sufficiently tested at this point

ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:16] <ogra> davidm, ^^ ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:17] <NCommander> Well, in either case, we still need to figure out how we're going to handle Moblin for Lucid 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:18] <ogra> *if* we handle it we have to, yes 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:18] <davidm> We will need to revisit, likely with a 2D launcher 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:18] <JamieBennett1> not sure what happened there 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:18] <ogra> davidm, moblin with a 2D launcher ?

ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:19] <GrueMaster> There is a high possibility that we will be seeing PSB drivers again in that time frame. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:19] <lool> Please let us use "moblin remix" not UMR 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:20] <NCommander> GrueMaster, ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:20]  * StevenK sobs 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:20] <persia> Last cycle, there was https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MobileTeam/KarmicSpecifications : why not do the same forhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/MobileTeam/LucidSpecifications ?

ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:21] <ogra> (assuming you return in lucid) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:21] <dyfet> I had put up one spec for broader discussion, but it is VoIP related, and not mobile centric

ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:26] <NCommander> I have an update with dove 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:26] <StevenK> lool: UNR is 680, I don't think I can shrink it 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:26] <ogra> lool, covered at the beginning 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:26] <StevenK> lool: I was going to add de/fr

ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:27] <StevenK> Testing! 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:27] <StevenK> Lots of testing! 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:27] <ogra> indeed !!!

ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:28] <StevenK> I'd like to upload casper 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:28] <ogra> paulliu, so how does moblin look ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:29] <StevenK> But I need to build an initrd that isn't broken 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:29] <paulliu> ogra: Just left some minor bugs. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:29] <ogra> runs and installs ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:29] <plars> haven't looked at the new image this morning yet, but according to lool the apt popup error should be fixed now 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:29] <paulliu> And those bugs are upstream bugs. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:29] <GrueMaster> Moblin Compliance testing failures down to 165, mostly programmatic errors at this point. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:29] <lool> We just have a new image published 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:29] <paulliu> ogra: yes. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:29] <ogra> cool !!! 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:29] <ogra> so pretty much on track it seems 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:29] <StevenK> GrueMaster: Our errors? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:30]  * ogra doesnt have errors 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:30] <paulliu> Moblin 2.1 preview is updated by Intel again. However we've freezed so not going to update the versions. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:30] <paulliu> It changes a lot. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:30] <GrueMaster> Don't know.  I am seeing the same errors on the LSB testing.  I think a lot of them are actually in the tests. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:30] <plars> GrueMaster: where are this posted? the last results I see say 173 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:30] <NCommander> GrueMaster, check the LSB sight to see what tests have errata and/or waviers 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:30] <NCommander> *site 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:30] <paulliu> ABI/API bump in foundation libraries. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:30] <GrueMaster> I will upload the new results this morning. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:30] <plars> GrueMaster: also, I don't recall, was there a comparison run with upstream moblin? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:30] <paulliu> So we are going to establish another PPA. OEM team have to update all the packages before this week. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:30] <GrueMaster> This is from Friday test run. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:30] <plars> GrueMaster: cool, thanks 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:31] <lool> paulliu: god  :-( 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:31] <ogra> oh my 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:31] <StevenK> paulliu: Argh! 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:31] <StevenK> paulliu: Why? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:31] <NCommander> paulliu, OW 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:31] <NCommander> paulliu, I do hope that the soversions and friends have been properly bumped 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:31] <paulliu> Don't worry. Personally I'll update Debian packages with OEM team so in Lucid we'll have newer versions. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:31] <GrueMaster> I haven't had a chance to run a comparison with upstream, mainly because they are missing a lot of necessary bits from their repository. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:31] <lool> It seems we didn't cover the UNR nor the moblin bugs 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:32] <plars> GrueMaster: that's a decent improvement from the previous, was that due to config changes, additional packages you installed, fixes made in the packages? what?

ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:32] <StevenK> GrueMaster: That isn't a solution 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:33] <GrueMaster> Some libraries are backwards compatible with older versions. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:33] <ogra> *some* 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:33] <ogra> ... 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:33] <GrueMaster> Some aren't, which caused more failures.  I ran a libcheck test on this before launching the main test run. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:33] <paulliu> GrueMaster: Ah. I'm sure it doesn't backward compatible. If updates that library, things are FTBFS. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:33] <paulliu> GrueMaster: So we have to update those stuff together.

ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:41] <NCommander> lool, yes I did 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:41] <dyfet> I tested Y0 of course, but yes, it worked

ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:42] <NCommander> As a heads up this week, I don't have my boards setup, I brought them withme in case the shit hits the fan, but unless needed, I do not plan to have them up and running so I'm not going to be available for ARM image testing 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:42] <NCommander> Anyway 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:42] <NCommander> time for me to board 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:42] <lool> NCommander: Good thanks 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:42] <NCommander> lool, I'll be back online in 1h-1:30 based on flight time. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:43] <NCommander> anyway 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:43] <ogra> and as a reminder i'm on the roda from tomorrow on, imx51 testing needs to be done by others until monday 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:43] <ogra> but i dont expect any regressions here, desktop works definately fine 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:43] <JamieBennett1> ogra: I can do some testing 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:43] <ogra> netinst and alternate work with some tinkering

ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:44] <ogra> and babbage :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:44] <JamieBennett1> looks like we have it covered then :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:44] <GrueMaster> yea, that too. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:44] <lool> can we close bug #450940?

ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:44] <cjwatson> note I made some corrections to NCommander's ubiquity changes, so it does need further testing 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:45] <plars> GrueMaster: have you tried the recent images on Y0 to see if that's still a problem? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:45] <cjwatson> with specific attention to the behaviour of the mountpoint drop-down when creating or editing uboot partitions in ubiquity's manual partitioner 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:45] <GrueMaster> The Y0 I have has the updated firmware and wasn't a problem to begin with. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:45] <GrueMaster> I traded with Brad last week. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:46] <lool> I'll go ahead and close 450940

ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:46] <GrueMaster> not yet. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:47] <plars> lool: I haven't yet, but my suspicion is that it does not resume

ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:48] <lool> plars: IMO do order enough parts that you can test the two at the same time; check with davidm but I think it's going to be important for release that we can test quickly multiple platforms at the same time 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:48] <GrueMaster> I'll try to get to it.  My babbage has been focusing on the sata issue lately, but I can move the drive to a usb cable.

ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:48] <plars> lool: right, I had to make an unexpected  change 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:48] <ogra> soo, is that all for armel ... 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:48] <GrueMaster> lool: I agree.  I have 7 systems at my desk right now, all of which are accessible. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:48] <ogra> lool, speak up ! 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:48] <lool> GrueMaster: You can test suspend resume from cmdline if you like  :) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:49] <GrueMaster> Better to test with gui. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:49] <lool> Well I think nobody is chasing the toolchain issues except doko 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:49] <GrueMaster> More involved. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:49] <davidm> plars, order parts to have both boards up and running 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [14:49] <ogra> suspend should work from livefs

ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:07] <Keybuk> and the MC now send their reviews to the DMB 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:07] <Keybuk> I think we can consider this complete, modulo documentation changes 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:07] <Keybuk> jono: you took the action for those, how's that going? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:08] <pitti> o/ (sorry for being late) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:08] <jono> Keybuk, sorry, which actions? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:08] <kees> pitti: np, just reviewed actions, and now covering last item of DMB 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:08] <Keybuk> jono: updating governance documentation to reflect that the DMB is now handling developer applications, not the TB

ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:09] <jono> sorry about that 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:09] <Keybuk> np, will carry over 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:09] <jono> thanks 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:09] <Keybuk> I'll remove the standing agenda item now in favour of tracking actions

ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:10] <Keybuk> I was right, I didn't have time 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:10] <jono> thanks Keybuk 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:11] <Keybuk> since the release is next week, this seems ok to defer 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:11] <kees> does anything remain other than a vote for the unit policy? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:11] <bdrung> maybe improve the wording 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:12] <bdrung> are the any objection that should be discussed? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:12] <Keybuk> the exception also seemed ... odd 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:12] <cjwatson> erk, sorry I'm late 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:12] <Keybuk> e.g. "only the prefix is displayed and not the unit (e.g. M instead of MB)" 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:13] <Keybuk> it seems much less difficult to simply state that traditional UNIX command-line tools are exempt, provided they provide options to select the output sizes

ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:15] <Keybuk> mdz: ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:15] <smoser> this is my topic, but I am not exactly sure what is expected of me. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:16] <mdz> smoser sent an RFC to ubuntu-devel 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:16] <smoser> the link above describes the proposal regarding support / updates to ec2 images. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:16] <mdz> the basic issue is that Ubuntu for EC2 is distributed as a pre-installed image 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:16] <mdz> and the EC2 model is such that updates are not applied in the usual manner 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:17] <mdz> (if they are, it needs to be done on every boot) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:17] <mdz> so he has proposed that we should periodically refresh the images to incorporate updates 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:17] <kees> sounds reasonable. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:17] <Keybuk> ah, I wondered what he was proposing 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:17] <mdz> he hasn't received any feedback on the proposal yet 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:17] <cjwatson> that's the case for live CDs too, but I can see how UEC images are different since the usage model is different 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:17] <Keybuk> he used lots of terms and abbreviations that only cloud people know ;) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:18] <smoser> (above, it is not on "every boot", but on every first boot of a new instance) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:18] <Keybuk> so it's entirely possible nobody outside of the UEC team knew what he was on about <g> 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:18] <mdz> Keybuk: he did explain pretty clearly in the email, but it was long 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:18] <Keybuk> mdz: I disagree 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:18] <Keybuk> I read the entire e-mail 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:18] <Keybuk> an I've just re-read it 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:18] <Keybuk> and your one line explanation was far clearer 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:19] <Keybuk> (remember, you know about cloud - I don't) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:19] <mdz> on EC2, the root filesystem and kernel are published separately, so it is possible to update the kernel while leaving the root filesystem alone, and vice versa 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:19] <mdz> so he has proposed separate policies for when to update each 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:19] <cjwatson> my main concern is release management; we know that point releases are a big whack of work, so this needs to be much more lightweight 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:19] <kees> I would think a place like www.ubuntu.com/ec2-version-query/... would make a better official place to get AMI updates than on ~soren 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:19] <mdz> when the kernel is updated, the rootfs would always be updated as well (since it contains the modules) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:20] <Keybuk> is the rootfs like a ramfs? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:20] <mdz> kees: smoser is in the process of replacing the (prototype) ~soren thing with something more official 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:20] <Keybuk> or is the ramdisk something different? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:20] <mdz> Keybuk: it's typically a compressed writable filesystem 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:20] <mdz> the ramdisk is the initrd 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:20] <smoser> Keybuk, rootfs is a partition image (consumed by xen) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:20] <mdz> so there is kernel (AKI) and ramdisk (ARI) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:21] <Keybuk> what about the cases where you update the ramdisk and accidentally include updates to things like udev that aren't on the rootfs yet? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:21] <mdz> an AMI is a rootfs + a reference to an AKI and ARI used to boot it 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:21] <mdz> smoser: have I got that right? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:21] <smoser> mdz, yes. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:21] <Keybuk> if you update the kernel, you need to update the initrd and root filesystem since they have modules on them 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:21] <mdz> when an EC2 user wants to start a new Ubuntu system up, they just specify the AMI they want 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:21] <Keybuk> if you update the root filesystem, you need to update the initrd too because it contains bits of it 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:21] <kees> Keybuk: AIUI, you run the risk of hosing your image. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:22] <mdz> the AMI is a short, inscrutable hex number 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:22] <Keybuk> if you update the initrd, you run the disk of including updates that aren't on the root filesystem yet 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:22] <Keybuk> separate policies for them seems like a very bad idea 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:22] <smoser> Keybuk, i will admit to not having thought of that.  However, the proposal is that a kernel update indicates a new root. so it should not be an issue. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:22] <sabdfl> are there items in the ramdisk which could trigger an update too? as i read it, it's only kernel updates that do so 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:23] <kees> I think the point is that it's not just the kernel changing that should trigger an ARI/AMI update. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:23] <Keybuk> smoser: so when would you not just update all three bits at the same time? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:23] <Keybuk> as I see it, kernel implies initrd and rootfs update 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:23] <smoser> any time the rootfs is updated it will take the most recent kernel/ramdisk at the time. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:23] <Keybuk> initrd means you must also update the rootfs otherwise you'll screw yourself one day 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:24] <Keybuk> rootfs means you must also update the initrd 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:24] <Keybuk> smoser: you can't do that 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:24] <smoser> any time kernel/ramdisk is updated (in builds) it forces a refresh of root 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:24] <Keybuk> if you update the rootfs, you must update the ramdisk too 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:24] <mdz> a rootfs update does not generally require a kernel update, and may not require an initrd update 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:24] <Keybuk> mdz: disagree strongly 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:24] <mdz> Keybuk: generally, yes, but not always 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:25] <mdz> Keybuk: an update to screen or w3m does not require a new initrd 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:25] <cjwatson> can we determine this ad-hoc, based on (e.g.) the set of updates since the last image? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:25] <mdz> Keybuk: I don't necessarily disagree with you that we should update them in sync, as that would be simpler 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:25] <Keybuk> mdz: and the cost of determining that for each release? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:25] <Keybuk> that starts to put a larger release management overhead for these 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:25] <cjwatson> we can tell automatically whether a package calls update-initramfs in its postinst, plus perhaps a small number of exceptions 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:25] <cjwatson> (e.g. busybox-initramfs, don't ask) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:26] <Keybuk> my between-the-lines reading was that you wanted light release management of "update the images this week" 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:26] <Keybuk> is there a Bad Thing of just updating the three bits together 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:26] <Keybuk> at least then you vastly reduce your testing matrix 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:26] <mdz> we want a clear (preferably automatable) test to say "yes it is time to roll an update" 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:26] <Keybuk> otherwise you really should be testing all combinations of kernel, initrd and rootfs 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:26] <smoser> I apologize for being dense here, but I believe the proposal is to update the 3 bits together. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:27] <smoser> Keybuk, where do you see something that doesn't state that? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:27] <Keybuk> smoser: honestly, I can't understand half of your proposal 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:27] <Keybuk> I don't know what an aki, ami, ari or uzi are ;) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:27] <smoser> Keybuk, fair enough. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:27] <mdz> Keybuk: I just explained 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:28] <Keybuk> can we not just simply it to "UEC Image" ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:28] <Keybuk> rather than resorting to jargon? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:28] <sabdfl> the proposal is mostly useful to people who do understand ubuntu and ec2. now that mdz's explained, scott, you could read it again and see if you're happy with it in the light of your newfound insight ;-) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:29] <mdz> Keybuk: sure 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:29] <cjwatson> "At the time of publish, AMIs will be associated with the latest AKI/ARI 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:29] <cjwatson> that is available." 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:29] <cjwatson> I think Scott is requesting that we just bundle up a new AKI/ARI at the same time, too 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:30] <Keybuk> sabdfl: I am doing so, and I think the proposal is still vastly overworded now I think I get it 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:30] <cjwatson> or at least a new ARI (initrd), it's probably fairly easy to see when the AKI (kernel) doesn't need to change 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:30] <Keybuk> cjwatson: right, I think that's what I mean 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:30] <kees> IIUC, proposal is: if anything changes in kernel or ramdisk, AKI/ARI/AMI is generated.  otherwise, just AMI. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:31] <mdz> kees: that's my understanding as well 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:31] <sabdfl> can we always detect that something needs to change in the rd? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:31] <kees> which means as long as there is a way to discover "current AMI", a user will always have the latest of everything published. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:32] <sabdfl> kees: no, i don't think the proposal is to roll a new set every time there is any update at all 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:32] <mdz> kees: which is covered by the "Currency" section 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:32] <sabdfl> just kernel updates, major security updates, and when the queue of updates is big 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:32] <cjwatson> sabdfl: initrd change> yes (I think), but it may be more work than is worth it 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:32] <smoser> if there is a reason to always update kernel/ramdisk with each new AMI, then I do not have a good reason why that should not occur. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:33] <Keybuk> smoser: I don't think you need to update the kernel bit (AKI?) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:33] <kees> sabdfl: right, I should restate it as: when something important changes in kernel or ramdisk, AKI/ARI/AMI is generated.  otherwise, just AMI. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:33] <Keybuk> if there's no new kernel, that's a static image 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:33] <cjwatson> the initrd is tiny and quick to build by comparison with the rest 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:33] <Keybuk> if you can auto-detect whether a new ARI is needed for a given AMI, then ok, otherwise I'd recommend always rolling a new ARI with a new AMI 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:33] <Keybuk> (did I get that right? :p) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:33] <smoser> Keybuk, ah. ok. now i'm undertanding the problem. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:33] <cjwatson> Keybuk: my counter-proposal would be: when something important changes in kernel or ramdisk, AKI/ARI/AMI is generated.  otherwise, ARI and AMI 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:34] <cjwatson> kees: ^- 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:34] <Keybuk> cjwatson: isn't that what I just said? :p 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:34] <cjwatson> Keybuk: sorry, I meant to direct that to kees 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:34] <kees> cjwatson, Keybuk: yeah, good. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:34] <cjwatson> this is basically just defensive programming, since it's not trivial (not *that* hard, but) to tell when the initrd needs to change, and it's not that expensive to just change it anyway 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:35] <Keybuk> cjwatson: agree 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:35] <mdz> smoser: is there any cost related to releasing a new ARI which we might not be aware of? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:35] <smoser> not that i can think of. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:36] <Keybuk> . o O { why do UEC images have ramdisks anyway, surely the kernel can just mount the rootfs? } 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:36] <smoser> only that I had previously assumed kernel:ramdisk was 1:1, not 1:N 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:36] <mdz> ok, in that case I think I more or less agree with cjwatson, except s/ or ramdisk/ 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:36] <mdz> i.e.: if the kernel changes, roll a new AKI/ARI/AMI, otherwise, roll new ARI/AMI with the old AKI 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:36] <Keybuk> mdz: right, good catch 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:37] <Keybuk> ARI changes means ARI/AMI not AKI/ARI/AMI 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:37] <kees> Keybuk: I thought you had concerns about ramdisky things like udev? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:37] <cjwatson> mdz: yes 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:37] <mdz> Keybuk: good question 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:37] <mdz> smoser: is it possible to omit the ramdisk, technically? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:38] <Keybuk> kees: ramdisky things like udev would be fine in that situation - my concern is the udev version in the ramdisk and rootfs being out of sync with each other 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:38] <smoser> from a 'allowed by amazon' perspective, yes 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:38] <Keybuk> kees: since they transfer data by a secret protocol known to no man that changes with the winds ;) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 === RainCT_ is now known as RainCT 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:38] <smoser> i'm not sure as to whether or not our kernels have all the needed drivers built in. but obviously they could. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:39] <mdz> obviously that's not an option for 9.10 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:39] <smoser> right. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:39] <mdz> or older releases 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:39] <mdz> so we need to address the ramdisk question anyway 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:39] <kees> Keybuk: ok 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:39] <mdz> and can look at whether it can be eliminated in lucid 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:39] <Keybuk> so, new AKI -> new AKI/ARI/AMI 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:39] <Keybuk> new ARI or AMI -> new ARI/AMI 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:39] <Keybuk> ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:40] <mdz> smoser: do we presently provide any mechanism by which updates can be automatically installed at boot time? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:40] <smoser> via user-data. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:40] <mdz> or is that something that users have to roll their own? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:40] <smoser> ie, if user boots with '--user-data "#!/bin/sh\napt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade"' 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:40] <mdz> smoser: ok, so they can pass in a script which does it, but we don't provide a simple toggle or anything 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:40] <smoser> that will get done. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:40] <smoser> mdz, correct, we do not. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:41] <smoser> there is not at the moment a general "config" like format to feed to an instance, only scripts. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:42] <mdz> smoser: ok, so for 9.10 purposes, users are on their own with regard to keeping up to date 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:42] <smoser> correct. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:42] <mdz> in that case, does it make sense to measure the size of updates or time to install? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:42] <mdz> should we rather just update it every N days or whenever there's a critical issue? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:42] <mdz> (for 9.10) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:43] <mdz> kees: have you considered how this would tie into the security team's process?  presumably the USN should mention the new AMI where appropriate 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:43] <smoser> I do not have the experience with SRU that others here have. but it seems that updating every N days when there are zero (or very few) updates is overkill. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:44] <kees> mdz: we have been pushing for ec2 to have a way for people to "get the latest".  I don't want to delay kernel publications on an update of AKI. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:44] <mdz> smoser: my point was, if that criterion is based on the assumption that everyone will install updates at boot, is that a valid assumption given that it relies on the user to implement it manually? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:44] <mdz> kees: what if the security team could push a new AKI? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:45] <smoser> that is a valid question.  I have had the feeling from others that it is fairly common to do update on first (or every) boot 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:45] <mdz> smoser: which is an EC2 question rather than SRU 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:45] <mdz> smoser: ok 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:45] <kees> mdz: I would rather got gain that responsibility as it sets a bad precedence.  we are basically "upstream" for all derivatives. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:46] <mdz> smoser: we certainly shouldn't do an update if there are no updates to packages in the image 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:46] <smoser> realize that the image as it is is basically useless, so each instance that is created will have *something* done to it to make it useful to the user 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:46] <sabdfl> could we move all the kernel bits from the rootfs into the rd? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:46] <smoser> likely they realize that one of the things they should do is update 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:46] <mdz> smoser: right, and we are assuming that a standard part of everyone's user-data script (who cares about security) is to install updates 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:46] <smoser> correct 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:46] <mdz> which seems reasonable at this stage, though in the future I think we should explore simplifying that 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:47] <mdz> e.g. have unattended-upgrades automatically run at boot on EC2? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:47] <mdz> something to think about for the future 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:48] <smoser> yes. i think that it is reasonable to have that as a default that can be easily turned off 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:48]  * kees agrees strongly 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:48] <mdz> smoser: it sounds like there is general agreement that 1) it is appropriate to issue new images periodically, 2) when to update AKI vs. ARI vs. AMI 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:49] <mdz> does anyone have concerns with smoser's proposal to refresh based on time-to-install-updates or an approximation thereof? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:49] <sabdfl> fine by me 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:49] <Keybuk> seems ok 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:50] <mdz> how about the support lifetime section, which basically says we will continue to provide updated images for the maintenance lifetime of the product? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:50] <kees> it was time-to-install or security update criticality  (AMI Updates / Stable Releases / a & b) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:50] <mdz> for 8.04 LTS and 9.10+ 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:50] <Keybuk> that seems logical 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:50] <sabdfl> +1 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:50] <mdz> kees: yes, thanks for the correction 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:50]  * kees now 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:50] <kees> er 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:50] <Keybuk> we support an Ubuntu install with some updates installed for the same time period 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:50]  * kees nods 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:51] <Keybuk> philosophically speaking, these images are just an alternate way of providing the same updates 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:51] <mdz> so I think that leaves only 1) how users will find out about, and start using, the new AMIs (Currency) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:51] <mdz> are there any other outstanding questions or concerns? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:52] <mdz> I agree with Keybuk that it would help if the document were condensed 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:52] <mdz> now that we have consensus, it should probably be made more procedural, i.e. step-by-step decision-making and release process, rather than explanation/RFC 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:54] <smoser> I will update the wiki document. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [15:54] <Keybuk> ok

ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:12] <mdz> it is not marked as a regression 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:12] <kirkland> mdz: possibly; the consensus from upstream was that dynamic block storage attach/detach are not heavily used or tested 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:13] <jdstrand> the attach/detach work 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:13] <kirkland> mdz: given eucalyptus' dependency on that, it might be worth us investing some time/effort testing and developing this upstream 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:13] <mdz> jdstrand: is it a regression? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:13] <jdstrand> that is what I was testing, and I accidentally attached a device two times in a row with the same target dev 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:13] <jdstrand> and it segfaulted

ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:13] <smoser> it is not a regression from jaunty 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:14] <mdz> ok, in that case I would not  consider it critical for karmic 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:14] <ttx> if its avoidable in normal use, I would not keep it as a RC bug 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:14] <smoser> it was at best random success there. 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:14] <mdz> it likely doesn't affect eucalyptus 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:14] <mdz> and it doesn't sound like a "normal" use case 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:14] <jdstrand> I can say that anyone in the libvirtd group, or with qemu+ssh//<host>/system access can DoS libvirtd with this 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:14] <ttx> mdz: should we still keep it as a karmic-nominated bug ? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:15] <mdz> ttx: smoser and I discussed bug 451881. since it only affects UEC, and not EC2, it is not critical for karmic (though he will continue to investigate) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:15] <ttx> i.e. moving it to the next list ?

ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:25] <mdz> jdstrand: (yes) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:26] <mdz> but now we need to talk about 453453 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:26] <kirkland> sounds support has come and gone, come and gone in karmic 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:26] <mdz> this is Medium, which I agree with; not sure why it's targeted to Karmic though 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:26] <mdz> oh, because it's a regression 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:26] <mdz> jdstrand: er, yes, my last question was about 453453, not 453495 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:26] <kirkland> i have verified that sound works when running kvm from the command line 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:26] <kirkland> but not when through libvirt 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:27] <jdstrand> actually, I see it work in libvirt too 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:27] <mdz> kirkland: when run through libvirt, does sound just not work, or does it make the VM unusable? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:27] <jdstrand> I think it is highly dependent on what is going on in the host as to whether or not it hangs the guest when initializing the sound device or if there is sound at all in the guest 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:27] <kirkland> mdz: i saw the hang jdstrand mentions for the first time on Friday 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:27] <kirkland> mdz: it's a race or something; non-deterministic failure 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:28] <jdstrand> I agree with kirkland's assessment 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:28]  * kirkland borrowed jdstrand's assessment, probably :-) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:28] <mdz> kirkland: if it's come and gone, was there an earlier bug report about it? 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:28] <jdstrand> probably why it sounded *so right* ;) 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:29] <kirkland> mdz: no 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:29] <mdz> at this point it doesn't seem realistic to do anything about this bug for 9.10, though we could consider it for SRU 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:29] <mdz> kirkland: your call; please either milestone for karmic-updates or wontfix for karmic 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:29] <mdz> need to keep moving 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:29] <mdz> bug 453467 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:29] -ubottu- Launchpad bug 453467 in virt-manager "virt-manager traceback if select an architecture on VM creation" [Low,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/453467 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:29] <kirkland> mdz: sound issues in VM's are *extremely* low priority, for me 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:30] <mdz> this is Low 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:30] <mdz> this seems related to the other bug, selecting an architecture 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:30] <mdz> doesn't seem 9.10-critical to me 
ubuntu-meeting 2009-10-20 [16:31] <mdz> bug 407949
